BBC,Business,"LIVETrump says US-UK trade deal being announced today is 'full and comprehensive'The deal will be unveiled at 10:00 ET / 15:00 BST, and is expected to reduce tariffs on certain US and UK goods.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cn91dxzv4pnt,"Jen MeierhansBusiness reporter As we've been reporting this morning, the US and UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs later - described by Trump as a ""major trade deal"". It won't be a free-trade agreement, which has to be cleared by Congress. What is announced today is likely to be only the bare bones of a narrow agreement. Here's a look at what it could contain: Cars will be important Steel and aluminium pact Pharmaceuticals are a big unknown Digital services tax olive branch Food standards will not be included Read our full story here. Faisal IslamEconomics editor The key diplomatic win is that an agreement on tariffs will keep the US sweet while leaving the door open to a deal with Europe - which would be much more economically significant for the UK. Economically, this US deal is likely to be relatively small. Itâs about the rolling back of some of the trade damage done by Donald Trumpâs original announcement. In contrast, the EU is the UKâs largest trading partner. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was clear about it being a priority when I interviewed her recently, suggesting that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US. ""I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,"" she told me. Liv McMahonTechnology reporter It is rumoured that the British government will reduce its tax on US digital services as part of the deal to reduce tariffs. The digital services tax was introduced in April 2020 under the  then Conservative government, with the aim of making overseas tech firms accountable for financial value contributed by UK users. It charges businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces a flat 2% rate tax on revenues derived from UK users. Firms only have to pay it if they raise more than Â£500m in global revenues and Â£25m from UK users annually. But this is a threshold easily met by US tech titans, such as Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, raising billions annually worldwide each year. The UK reportedly, external netted nearly Â£360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year. Of course, we wonât actually know whether it is set to be narrowed until the US-UK tariffs agreement is unveiled this afternoon. In weighing up whether to make the concession, the UK will have had to consider several competing pressures - such as its drive to raise revenue and further growth with the political risk of being seen to concede to big tech, or President Trump. Donald Trump has just posted again on Truth Social and says: ""The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come. ""Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honour to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!"" Dharshini DavidDeputy economics editor British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover announced it was pausing shipments in April due to the impact of Trump's tariffs. The potential tariff pact could offer considerable relief to the car and pharmaceuticals industries - but may not significantly shift the dial for British economic growth. The industries at the heart of discussions make up less than a third of the UKâs exports of goods to the US, the total value of those equal to less than 1% of GDP. The baseline 10% universal tariff on most goods sold into the US seems set to remain. Moreover, thereâs what the UK may have to surrender in return for these concessions - including revenues raised by the digital devices tax. The UK-India deal agreed earlier this week may only bump up our GDP by 0.1% - a US tariff pact may be less significant. Nonetheless, smoothing things over in this key relationship -and being first in line for such a pact - is of huge symbolic importance for the UK in the new global trade (dis)order. Trump has just said today should be ""a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom,"" in a post on Truth Social. The US president reiterates that there will be a news conference at the Oval Office at 10:00 local time (15:00 BST). Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in April ""the global economy will suffer"" after Trump imposed tariffs Itâs inevitable that some politicians will point to Brexit as helping make todayâs US-UK trade agreement possible. Whatever is in the agreement in the coming hours, we will see a clear difference in the way President Donald Trump is treating London and Brussels. Thatâs because at 11:00 BST we are also expecting an announcement from the EU about what countermeasures it will take if its own efforts to reach a deal fail. Itâs possible to see that as simply good preparation or a negotiating tactic to get more out of the US but it also points to the difficulty of getting a deal done. Ireland's Enterprise Minister Peter Burke has told the BBC it will be âvery challengingâ for the EU to get an agreement sorted before Julyâs deadline. Thatâs despite the importance of EU-US trade, a relationship worth nearly $1tn (Â£750bn) last year. Nick EdserBusiness reporter In return for striking a deal on tariffs with the US, the UK is likely to reduce some of the levies it charges on US goods entering the country. The UK currently imposes a 10% tariff on US car imports, but this is expected to be cut. Last month, US business groups were looking at lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5%, and the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, indicated she was open to a cut to secure a wider trade deal. Taxes on US tech firms could also be altered. At the moment the UKâs Digital Services Tax imposes a 2% levy on revenues of tech giants which raises about Â£800m a year. It affects the likes of US firms such as Amazon and Meta, but there is speculation the tax could be lowered. Tariffs on US farm products could also be cut but, as Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out earlier this year, the UK will not accept US production standards such as chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Chris MasonPolitical editor May is rapidly becoming a month when weâll be hearing quite a lot about UK trade deals. There was the one with India announced the other day. The week after next there will be a UK-EU Summit in London at which a new deal is expected, and now todayâs announcement with America. It is worth remembering that rather a lot can hang under the loose phrase of a trade deal â and the arrangements will vary significantly. What we expect in the announcement later is a focus on tariffs or import taxes - in particular, cars. The government will want to talk up whatever it has managed to do to ease the impact of the tariffs imposed by America last month. As ever with deals like this, what are the trade-offs? Many are keeping a keen eye on the digital services tax, which was introduced in the UK five years ago âto ensureâ¦large multinational businessesâ¦make a contribution to supporting vital public servicesâ. It generates around Â£800m a year in revenue â is it reduced as part of this deal? Expect to see the British government herald the achievement of doing this deal first, before others â and that is unquestionably something of a win. But it will also be worth asking: How much is this an improvement on current trading conditions? And, how much is it an improvement on - six months ago â before President Trumpâs tariffs explosion? Prime Minister Keir Starmer briefly references the trade deal with the US during a statement on defence this morning. Starmer talks about working more closely with allies and describes the US as ""indispensable"" for economic and national security. âAs you know, talks with the US have been ongoing, and you will hear more from me about that later today,â he says. In his statement, marking 80 years since the end of WW2, Starmer says heâll act in the national interest, for workers, businesses and families âto deliver security and renewal for our countryâ. Earlier, Downing Street confirmed Starmer will make an announcement about a deal with the US on tariffs today. This video can not be played Starmer teases trade deal announcement today Jaguar Land Rover has reportedly resumed exports to the US, after pausing them because of the 25% US tariffs A UK business group has welcomed the trade announcement coming later today. Jordan Cummins, UK competitiveness director at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), tells the BBC's Business Today programme the ""rhetoric"" around tariffs has ""bitten the bottom line"" and ""fed through into output and labour"". ""There are parts of our economy that are really feeling this and they need a big symbolic gesture backed up by some credibility from the government,"" Cummins says. He adds that quick movement, especially on steel and cars â both of which have been hit with a 25% import tariff by the US â is ""exactly what we need to see"". Faisal IslamEconomics editor Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been clear that food
standards - for example, allowing imports of chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef - will not feature in this deal for domestic political reasons. This is an area where the UK
has chosen alignment with EU - and the forthcoming ""Brexit reset"" with the EU - over the US. It would be a diplomatic win for the UK if the US has accepted
even a narrow deal while dropping demands in this area. Indeed the chancellor
hinted at this in her interview with me in Washington. The big question here, which I pressed Rachel Reeves about, external, is really
why the US in any way justifies levying a so-called 10% reciprocal tariff
against UK goods. On its own measures, the US sells more to us than it buys from us - ie, there is nothing to ""reciprocate"" against. If a trade deficit is a sign of ""cheating"" as the White House argues, then it is the UK that is suffering. The underlying 10%
tariff looks like staying in place. This is also an important signal to the
rest of the world, and to the markets about substantive moves away from a
global trade war. Nick EdserBusiness reporter The pound jumped initially against the US dollar on reports of
a US-UK deal, but the gains were short-lived. Sterling initially climbed 0.5% against the dollar to reach $1.3356
in Asian trade overnight. But it wasnât long before it fell back again, and is currently trading just below $1.32 â close to where it was before news of a
trade deal emerged. On the stock market, the FTSE 100 index of the biggest
UK-listed companies opened little-changed, edging up about five points to 8,564. The financial markets will have a lot to take in today. As
well as the trade deal announcement, the Bank of England is expected
to cut interest rates later, and will also publish its latest forecasts for UK economy. Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, says a US-UK deal ""would be welcome and another Brexit benefit"". However, Griffith says restoring growth to the economy ""also requires reversing Labour's attacks on business"" and reducing ""high energy costs"". ""Conservatives will closely scrutinise any deal which should first be announced to Parliament,"" he says. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper says Parliament ""must be given a vote"" on the deal so it can be ""scrutinised"". ""A good trade deal with the US could bring huge benefits, but Liberal Democrats will oppose any concessions that threaten our NHS, undermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires,"" she says. ""If the government is confident the agreement it has negotiated with Trump is in Britain's national interest, it should not be afraid to bring it before MPs."" Faisal IslamEconomics editor When I was in the US last month, Chancellor Rachel Reeves hosted the cream of American business and Congress at a packed reception at the embassy, hosted by Ambassador Lord Mandelson. The talk was that the
US-UK deal had been done and all it was waiting for was the final nod from
President Trump. It appears that has now happened. But there is a notable
difference in how the UK and the US have been describing this arrangement. The chancellor told me about an ""economic and prosperity deal"" but the president
calls this a ""major trade deal"". This difference has been there since Keir Starmer met the president in the Oval Office. The narrow scope appears to have
meant some consideration of lower tariffs for US
exports of cars to the UK (from 10% to 2.5%). In return, the UK could win some
sort of tariff-free or lower tariff quota exemption from the 25% tariffs on
cars. This is the UKâs biggest goods export. The generosity or not of this
depends entirely on the number agreed. Something similar could apply in
steel. The big problem was pharmaceuticals. The president has not announced his
trade restrictions on medicines yet. The danger was for the UK to agree a deal,
but then be hit by a subsequent global tariff on its second most important
goods export. Simon JackBusiness editor The UK government has confirmed it will announce an agreement on tariffs later today. Currently the US imposes tariffs of 25% on steel, aluminium and cars - with a baseline or universal tariff of 10% on nearly everything else. The 25% car tariffs have bitten hard as cars are the UK's number one export to the US - worth around Â£9 billion last year. JLR sold 100,000 vehicles in the US last year and temporarily paused exports last month. What car industry executives are keen to learn is whether there will be an across-the-board lowering of tariffs, or whether a quota system will be imposed under which tariffs are low or zero, with additional charges on vehicles above that quota. Industry executives have told the BBC they much prefer the former - as a quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively. But as one executive said - a quota system would be ""better than nothing"". In return, the UK may abolish or reduce the 2% digital sales tax imposed on large US ecommerce sellers like Amazon. This was expected to raise Â£800 million a year and was imposed to help level the playing field for high street and smaller retailers - so a non-trivial concession if given. Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent The UK has been desperate for a deal of this sort with the US since President Trump unleashed his wave of global tariffs. So have other countries. It seems the UK has got there first - a significant achievement by Keir Starmer and his government. In fact, those close to the talks have been saying for some time that the shape of a deal was basically there, but that it was never quite clear when and whether the maverick president might sign off on what his negotiating team had thrashed out. That he has done so this week makes this a highly significant few days for UK trade, coming just two days after the full free trade agreement between the UK and India. Thereâs a clear political boost for the prime minister here too: finalising the deal with India his Conservative predecessors could not reach, and coming to some sort of agreement with the US - even if itâs short of the comprehensive free trade agreement the Conservative governments talked about reaching and never managed. And thereâs a broader point too. Starmer has made a point of forging a warm relationship with Trump  - warmer than many expected. There had been growing grumblings about what dividend he was receiving for his efforts, on trade, Ukraine and any number of other issues. Here is his answer. Downing Street has confirmed that Keir Starmer will make an announcement about a deal with the US on tariffs later today. A spokesperson for No 10 says the US is an ""indispensable ally for both our economic and national security"" and ""talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace"". ""The prime minister will update later today,"" they add. Dharshini DavidDeputy economics editor The US remains the UK's biggest single trading partner (in
terms of individual countries) - buying almost Â£200bn of British exports.  The UK's biggest goods exports by value last year were
cars and pharmaceuticals - hence why any tariff exemptions for those areas are important.  But
there are many more categories - from food to scientific equipment - which in
total account for the majority of goods exports.  However,
two-thirds of what the UK sells to the US is services - from advertising to banking
- which are unaffected by tariffs. Yet that growing importance makes maintaining close
ties key.  Overall the UK sells as much, broadly, to the US sells to the UK.  That trade balance - a far cry from the deficit of several hundred billions of dollars the US runs
with China - is one reason why President Trump is amenable to talks
with the UK. Todayâs expected announcement comes just days after the UK and India announced a trade deal. That deal will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and will cut taxes on Indiaâs clothing and footwear exports. Some Indian and British workers will also gain from a three-year exemption from social security payments, which the Indian government called ""an unprecedented achievement"". The exemption applies to the staff of Indian companies temporarily transferred to the UK, and to UK firms' workers transferred to India. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and ""deliver for British people and business"". Indiaâs prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was ""ambitious and mutually beneficial"".",2025-05-08
BBC,Business,What could be in the UK-US tariff deal?The two nations will announce a deal to reduce tariffs today - here's what could be in it.42 mins agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15ng4g5g0eo,"The US and the UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs later. It's thought US President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports will stay, but that the UK will see cuts to the 25% tariffs on some of its biggest exports. Here's a look at what could be in the deal. US President Donald Trump declared on social media the announcement to come later would be a ""major trade deal"" - it won't be. He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress. Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on Trump's tariffs. What it will be is some exemptions or lowering of those tariffs on specific goods. What is announced today is likely to be only the bare bones of a narrow agreement. There will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow. It could also be relatively short-term, covering just a few items. Currently, most goods imported from the UK to the US face a blanket 10% tariff and that's expected to remain. But this deal is likely to reduce tariffs on specific items set to be subject to higher tariffs. Trump has already placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US. Cars are our biggest export to the US - worth about £9bn last year. What we could get later is a lowering of this 25% tariff, or a quota system. A quota system would allow the UK to sell a certain number of cars into the US under low or zero tariffs, with extra charges on vehicles above that quota. Car industry leaders have told the BBC they would much prefer lower tariffs across the board - as a quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively. The UK currently imposes a 10% on US car imports, but is expected to lower this. The US has demanded the import tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated she is open to such a cut. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US came into effect in March. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK would ""keep all options on the table"", but did not announce immediate retaliation. The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, around £700m in total. However the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, including things such as gym equipment, furniture and machinery. These are worth much more, about £2.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year. Steel industry leaders have warned if the 25% tariff isn't lowered or removed it will be devastating for the industry. It's not known whether the agreement between the US and the UK will lead to a cut in the rate or the introduction of quotas. Tariffs could lead to US companies buying less from overseas. A knock-on effect could be more cheap steel flooding other markets, including the UK, as trade is redirected, putting more pressure on an already struggling industry. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is unknown. Most countries, including the US, imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, as part of an agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable. Pharmaceuticals are a major export for the UK when it comes to US trade – last year sales of medicinal and pharmaceutical products were worth £6.6bn ($8.76bn) making it the UK's second-biggest export to the US. It's also America's fourth biggest export to the UK, valued at £4bn ($5.3bn) last year. The president has not announced any trade restrictions on medicines yet. There is a danger that the UK could agree a deal, but is then subsequently hit by a global tariff. There is speculation the UK could lower its 2% digital services tax on US firms in return for lower tariffs on things like car and pharmaceutical exports. The tax is on businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces and applies to revenues derived from UK users. Firms only have to pay it if they raise more than £500m in global revenues and £25m from UK users annually. But this is a threshold easily met by US tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple. The UK reportedly netted nearly £360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year. In weighing up whether to cut this tax, the UK will have had to balance its drive to raise revenue and further growth with the political risk of being seen to concede to big tech, or President Trump. Tariffs on US farm products could also be cut. However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been clear that food standards - for example, allowing imports of chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef - will not feature in this deal for domestic political reasons. This is an area where the UK has chosen alignment with EU - and the forthcoming ""Brexit reset"" with the EU - over the US. Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s. The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones. It would be seen as a diplomatic win for the UK if the US has accepted even a narrow deal while dropping demands in this area.",2025-05-08
BBC,Business,iPhone maker announces plan to build Mitsubishi EVsThe Taiwan-made electric vehicle is expected to go on sale in Australia and New Zealand next year.10 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7974l151po,"Foxconn, the maker of Apple's iPhones, has announced plans to produce electric vehicles (EV) for Japanese car giant Mitsubishi Motors. Under the agreement in principle, a Foxconn joint venture will design and build cars in Taiwan for Mitsubishi. The companies say they expect the new model to be available by the end of next year, under what would be Foxconn's first major contract in the booming and highly competitive EV industry. Japanese car makers like Mitsubishi have faced growing competition from mainland Chinese rivals, particularly in markets in South East Asia, South America and Europe. The companies said the cars will be built by Foxtron - Foxconn's EV joint venture with Taiwanese car maker, Yulon Motor. ""Foxtron will provide design and manufacturing management services and this model is expected to enter the Australia and New Zealand markets in the second half of 2026,"" they added. At this stage, the agreement is a so-called memorandum of understanding - a non-binding deal between the two companies. The companies have said they ""will proceed with discussions towards a definitive agreement."" Foxconn is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and counts major technology companies such has Apple among its customers. It previously said it would consider buying a stake in Japan's Nissan Motor for ""co-operation"" as it looked to get into the motor industry. Mitsubishi Motors is a junior partner in an alliance between Nissan and French car maker Renault. The moves come as China's car industry has expanded rapidly in recent years and the world's second largest economy has emerged as a leader in the growing EV market. Established car makers around the world have struggled to compete as major Chinese players like BYD continue to win new customers.",2025-05-08
BBC,Business,Fed holds rates because of tariff 'uncertainty'The Federal Reserve said Trump's barrage of tariffs were generating too much uncertainty to predict its next moves.14 hrs agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglxldgx0l5o,"The US central bank has warned that President Donald Trump's tariffs have created ""so much uncertainty"" that it is unsure what to do about interest rates. The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it would keep interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs. But Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economic fallout from Trump's tariffs meant it was ""not at all clear"" what the bank should do next. The decision marked the third in a row without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate hovering around 4.3%. Powell said if Trump's tariff policies remain in place they were likely ""to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment"". Typically, the Fed cuts rates if it believes the economy is struggling and raises them if prices start to rise too quickly. But the bank - which is set up to make policy independent of the White House -said tariffs had raised the risk of both an economic slowdown and faster price rises, complicating its next move. ""It's really not at all clear what it is we should do,"" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. ""There's so much uncertainty."" Wednesday's decision is the Fed's first since Trump's tariff announcements last month raised import taxes on goods from countries around the world, with imports from China facing duties of at least 145%. Logistics firms and ports in the US have since reported sharp drops in trade, while analysts have warned that the risk of recession has ramped up significantly since the start of the year. Trump, who promised lower rates while campaigning for re-election last year, has called on the Fed to lower rates ""pre-emptively"" and flirted with firing the head of the bank, criticising him as ""a major loser"" and ""Mr Too Late"" for not cutting rates fast enough. The European Central Bank cut interest rates last month, citing concerns about the economy due to the trade tensions. The Bank of England is widely expected to take a similar step this week. Officials from the US and China are set to meet this week, but the scope of the talks remains unclear. Trump on Wednesday dismissed the idea of lowering tariff rates pre-emptively to help trade negotiations. Powell said the talks had the potential to change the economic picture ""materially"". ""Usually, things clarify and the appropriate direction becomes clear,"" he said. ""Right now it's very hard to say what that would be. In the meantime, the economy is doing fine."" The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year for the first time since 2022. But officials said those figures had been distorted by firms rushing goods into the country ahead of tariffs rather than a decline in wider activity. Hiring remained unexpectedly strong last month, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows of 4.2% while the US stock market has largely recovered from the sharp declines it saw last month. Powell said those figures gave the Fed time to wait. ""We can move quickly when that's appropriate but we think right now the appropriate thing to do is wait and see how things evolve,"" he said.",2025-05-08
BBC,Business,Apple hits back at US judge's 'extraordinary' contempt orderThe legal battle - started by Epic Games - could determine the future of the highly lucrative App Store.4 hrs agoTechnology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r8rg4w2v0o,"Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games. That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store. Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called ""extraordinary."" The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling ""core aspects of its business operations."" ""A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,"" the company's lawyers wrote. Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games. In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases. The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules. She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem. Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead. In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.  On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store. The company wrote that such restrictions ""will cost Apple substantial sums annually"" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful. ""Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,"" Apple wrote. Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives. In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to. ""Cook chose poorly,"" she wrote. The company documents she reviewed reveal ""that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option"", she wrote. Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals. Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. Outside the UK?

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Smokey Robinson denies sexual assault allegationsIn a statement, the singer's lawyer says the abuse allegations are an attempt to ""extract money"".3 hrs agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e5j8v227ko,"Motown legend Smokey Robinson has denied allegations of sexual assault that were made by several former employees. In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, four female housekeepers accused the singer-songwriter of sexual battery including rape, plus false imprisonment and a number of labour violations. In a statement to the BBC, Robinson's lawyer Christopher Frost called the allegations ""vile"" and ""false"". ""As this case progresses, the evidence (the crucial element that guides us) will show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon - $50 million, to be exact,"" he said. Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one hits like Mary Wells' My Guy and the Temptations' My Girl. He was both a talent scout for the record label and one of its most prominent recording artists in his own right, known for songs like Tracks of My Tears, Shop Around and Tears of a Clown. He has spots in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Halls of Fame, and claims to have credits on more than 4,000 songs. His second wife, Frances, was also named in Tuesday's lawsuit, which claimed she contributed to a hostile work environment and failed to stop Robinson's alleged sexual misconduct. The women are suing under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4, due to the sexual misconduct allegations, including rape, being levelled against the musician. In the 27-page lawsuit they detail several incidents dating back to 2006 and allege they were pressured into sex. All four women, who are of Hispanic descent, said they had not come forward until now because they feared losing their livelihood, familial reprisal or embarrassment. Some were concerned the allegations could affect their immigration status. They are seeking at least $50m in damages and a jury trial. No police reports or criminal charges have been filed against the musician. The women's lawyers held a press conference on Tuesday, accusing Robinson of being a ""serial and sick rapist"" who ""must be stopped"". This drew the ire of the Robinson's legal team, who called it a ""bizarre"" attempt ""to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create"". ""We will have more to say in the coming days as we make our legal response, and in time Mr Robinson will respond in his own words,"" Mr Frost said. ""We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold. ""We will be asking the Court to dismiss the lawsuit. We will also be asking the Court to address that in their statements to the press about Mr Robinson, the plaintiff's attorneys have reached beyond the bounds of liberties that even lawyers are typically allowed in this context.""",2025-05-08

The 46-year-old said in an Instagram video that he has ""clear cell renal carcinoma that had metastasised into my lung"", adding: ""And that's stage four, and that's not real good."" The band made it big in the early 2000s with hits like Kryptonite, Here Without You and It's Not My Time, and have sold more than 13 million albums in the US. ""Now, I believe It's Not My Time is really my song,"" Arnold wrote to fans in an accompanying caption. ""This'll be a battle so we need our prayers warriors!"" 3 Doors Down emerged from Mississippi to break through with their hit Kryptonite, which reached number three in the US in 2000. Their debut album The Better Life was the 11th biggest-selling album of the year in their home country. They returned to the top five with the 2002 singles Here Without You and When I'm Gone, and scored US number one albums with Seventeen Days in 2005 and a self-titled LP in 2008. They also performed at President Trump's first inauguration in 2017. In his video, the singer and drummer said: ""You know what, we serve almighty God, and he can overcome anything. So I have no fear. I am really, sincerely not scared of it at all. ""But it is going to force us to cancel our tour this summer, and we're sorry for that. ""And I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get, and I think it's time for me to maybe go listen to It's Not My Time a little bit, right?""

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Bella Ramsey backs keeping best actress awardsThe star, who is non-binary, says it's important that ""recognition for women in the industry is preserved"".1 day agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm8mny9k1mo,"The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey has voiced support for awards shows keeping separate categories for male and female performers. The British star, who identifies as non-binary and asks to be referred to with they/them pronouns, said it was important that ""recognition for women in the industry is preserved"". ""But then, where do non-binary or gender non-conforming people fit into that? I don't know,"" Ramsey added. Ramsey has been nominated for best actress at the Baftas and Emmys. Other ceremonies such the MTV and Brit Awards have switched to all-encompassing gender-neutral prizes as the entertainment industry grapples with how non-binary actors should be treated by awards shows. Organisers of the Oscars said last year they were ""exploring"" the idea of merging the best actor and actress categories. Ramsey told Louis Theroux's podcast: ""If people call me an actress, I have a guttural 'ugh, that's not quite right' instinct to it. ""But I just don't take it too seriously. It doesn't feel like an attack on my identity. It's just a funny thing that doesn't really fit."" Ramsey said they ""didn't find it insulting"" to be nominated for best actress at the Emmys. Theroux suggested that having a single category would mean ""basically a lot of women wouldn't get nominated"" - as happened when the Brits scrapped their best male and female categories in favour of a best artist award, and no women were nominated in 2023. Ramsey responded: ""I think it's so important that that's preserved - that the recognition for women in this industry is preserved. ""I think the gendered categories conversation's a really interesting one and I don't have the answer. I wish that there was something that was an easy way around it. ""I think that it is really important that we have a female category and a male category - but then, where do non-binary and gender con-conforming people fit into that? I don't know. ""I've literally sat and tried to think my way to the answer, and haven't got there. ""You could do it for the character portrayed - like, best performance in a female character. But then, what about when there are non-binary characters on screen? Which is few and far between at the moment. But where does a non-binary person playing a non-binary character fit in? I don't know. It's really complicated."" There has also been a move towards referring to all performers as actors rather than using the term actress, but Ramsey said many people prefer to be called an actress ""and are really comfortable in that"". ""I've always just called myself an actor, but I don't think that those words [like actress] have to be taken away."" The 21-year-old said they didn't think about the use of pronouns until The Last of Us started in 2023, ""and it was a question that I had and suddenly I had to choose"". ""I was so stressed out about it because I didn't know, and I didn't really care."" Ramsey said they rejected the term non-binary ""for so long"" because they didn't want to be seen as being ""trendy"". ""It was just something that had been very obvious since I was young. I'd always call myself a tomboy, but it wasn't that I was like a boyish girl. I was always a bit of an inbetween, leaning more to the boy's side to be honest. ""I feel like I grew up more as a little boy than I did a little girl. I always felt more masculine or... yeah, more on that side of the spectrum, I guess."" The question of how to categorise awards has been a long-running debate in the entertainment industry. Currently, most awards shows invite actors to submit themselves for the category they feel comfortable in. In 2022, The Crown's Emma Corrin, who identifies as non-binary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't think the categories are inclusive enough at the moment. It's about everyone being able to feel acknowledged and represented."" In 2023, Yellowjackets star Liv Hewson, also non-binary, didn't enter the Emmys, saying: ""There's not a place for me in the acting categories. It would be inaccurate for me to submit myself as an actress. It neither makes sense for me to be lumped in with the boys."" Others worry that gender-neutral categories would lead to women being underrepresented. After having all-male nominees for best artist in 2023, the Brits expanded the prize's shortlist from five to 10 acts. Trans actors are not affected by the issue, with Elliot Page being eligible for best actor and Karla Sofía Gascón for best actress.",2025-05-08

Larry Lamb, who played Mick Shipman on the BBC's hit show for 17 years, said filming the Christmas episode last year was an ""extraordinary experience."". He added: ""At the time, we all thought it probably won't be the end, I'm sure we will be doing it again, but gradually what's happened over the months, what I've realised is that was the end."" Lamb said he would always carry a part of Mick with him, and his upcoming tour for his new book, All Wrapped Up, has a Gavin and Stacey theme. The Christmas episode of the show racked up 19.11 million views, and Lamb said while it was sad it ended, it was a ""masterpiece, no doubt about it"". He added: ""That scene in the wedding - that's up for the moment of the year. ""It was the way to end this story, you can't keep going on with it. Ruth and James brought it to a grand finale.""

In between, Lamb will visit several bookshops and read extracts of his new novel.

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Ireland asks Eurovision organisers for discussion over IsraelThe director of Eurovision said no participating EBU member had publicly opposed Israeli broadcaster Kan's participation.17 hrs agoEurope,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjljw9j8yvo,"Irish national broadcaster RTÉ has asked the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for a discussion on Israel's inclusion in the Eurovision Song Contest. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was ""appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages"". Earlier, the director of the Eurovision Song Contest said no participating EBU member had publicly opposed Israeli broadcaster Kan's participation. The contest, which is hosted by the EBU, will begin on 13 May in Switzerland with the final on 17 May. Mr Bakhurst said RTÉ wanted a discussion ""notwithstanding the fact that the criterion for participating"" is membership of EBU. He added that he was mindful of RTÉ's obligations to maintain objectivity in covering the war in Gaza. ""We are also very mindful of the severe political pressure on Israel's public service broadcaster, Kan, from the Israeli government,"" he said. On Tuesday, more than 70  former Eurovision contestants, including Ireland's 1994 winner Charlie McGettigan, signed a letter urging organisers to ban Israel and Kan from the event. Members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) at RTÉ had also called on the broadcaster to oppose Israel's participation in a letter. Speaking on Wednesday to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Emma O'Kelly of the NUJ said she welcomed Mr Bakhurt's statement and that it was important to take a stand. ""We believe this is RTÉ listening to its staff, but more importantly, listening to public sentiment here in Ireland, which is just outrage at Israel's actions in Gaza,"" she said. ""We collectively — the NUJ and RTÉ — don't believe Israel should be afforded what is a massive cultural platform."" ""The Eurovision is literally the international stage,"" she added. ""We don't believe that the EBU should be giving a country such as this a platform."" Ms O'Kelly said this move is ""only about Israel's actions in Gaza"" and added that there is ""precedent for this"", citing Russia being unable to participate in the competition from 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Eurovision director Martin Green said: ""No participating EBU member broadcaster, who have all been widely consulted, has 'publicly opposed' Israeli broadcaster Kan's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest - despite the claims in another letter from RTÉ journalists. ""The broadcasters mentioned in the letter, RTVE in Spain and RTVSLO in Slovenia, requested a discussion and RÚV in Iceland has informed us of their foreign minister's comments on Kan's participation."" Mr Green said the organisers of the song contest ""understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East"". He said EBU was not ""immune to global events"" but members together should ensure the event remains a ""universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music"". Israel is to be represented in the contest by Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. She was at the Nova musical festival when Hamas attacked and killed 360 young partygoers and took 40 more hostage. At least 52,615 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,507 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. There were several campaigns to block Israel from taking part in the  Eurovision song contest last year, but the EBU ruled Israel was allowed to compete. Representing Israel last year, Eden Golan was booed whilst performing at a dress rehearsal for the competition, which took place in Malmo, Sweden and confined to her hotel room when she wasn't performing, due to threats of harm to the Israeli delegation. She placed fifth in the competition with her entry Hurricane. The grand final of the this year's Eurovision Song Contest will take place in St Jakobshalle, Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday 17 May. The semi-finals taking place on Tuesday 13 and Thursday 15 May. Thirty-seven countries will take part, with 10 winning through from each semi-final. Five countries - the UK, Spain, Germany, France and Italy are guaranteed places in the grand final, as is the host Switzerland.",2025-05-08
