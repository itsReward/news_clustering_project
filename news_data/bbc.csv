BBC,Business,Trump proposes 80% China tariff ahead of trade talks The meeting is the strongest sign yet that the world's two biggest economies are ready to de-escalate their trade war.9 hrs agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkvp6438ko,"US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting tariffs on goods from China, in his latest comment to signal interest in de-escalating the trade war between the world's two biggest economies. ""80% Tariff on China seems right,"" Trump wrote on social media on Friday, ahead of trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the meetings, saying Beijing had ""full confidence"" in its ability to manage trade issues with the US. Since April, Trump has hit items from China with import taxes of 145%, sending shockwaves through financial markets and driving down trade between the two countries. On Friday, official figures for April showed China's exports to the US fell by more than 20% compared to a year earlier. But at the same time its total exports rose by a better-than-expected 8.1%. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are ""under growing economic pressure"", Dan Wang from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC. ""The recent signals from both sides suggest a transactional de-escalation is on the table"", she added. The announcement earlier this week of the talks was welcomed as an important first step towards easing tensions but analysts have warned that this marks the start of what are likely to be lengthy negotiations. ""The systemic frictions between the US and China will not be resolved any time soon,"" said former US trade negotiator, Stephen Olson. Any cuts to tariffs as a result of this meeting are likely to be ""minor"", he added. The initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier and economic tsar He Lifeng. But ""I think everyone recognises that any final deal will require the active engagement of both presidents,"" Mr Olson said. Another trade expert said that even if the new tariffs imposed by Trump were lifted, the two countries would still have major issues to overcome. ""A realistic goal is probably at best a pullback from the sky-high bilateral tariffs but that would still leave in place high tariff barriers and various other restrictions"", the former head of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) China division, Eswar Prasad told BBC News. On social media on Friday, Trump called on China to ""open up its market"" to the US. He said any tariff reduction would be ""up to Scott B"". In earlier remarks on Thursday, he had said he expected a ""very friendly"" meeting. The talks between China and the US are set to take place just two days after the UK became the first country to strike a tariffs deal with the Trump administration. The US agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, in exchange for new access to US beef and other exports, according to an outline of the new agreement. Countries around the world are scrambling to make similar deals before steep US import taxes are due to take effect next month. Trump announced what he called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on dozens of countries in April but paused them shortly afterwards for 90 days to give their governments time to negotiate with his administration. Businesses based in the US will also be watching events in Switzerland closely. Wild Rye, a women's outdoor clothing firm based in the state of Idaho, has manufacturing stations in China and has been severely affected by the tariffs. The cost of shipping goods has jumped significantly, the firm's chief executive, Cassie Abel, told the BBC's Today programme. ""We have a purchase order that's incoming, which is around $700,000 [of goods] that's now costing £1.2m in levies up from £200,000,"" she said. Ms Abel added she was now looking to sell parts of her business to try to raise cash.

BBC,Business,Mexico sues Google over 'Gulf of America' name changePresident Sheinbaum argues Trump's executive order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf. 4 hrs agoWorld,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yk5nj7p7ko,"Mexico is suing Google for ignoring repeated requests not to call the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America on Google Maps for US users, President Claudia Sheinbaum says. She did not say where the lawsuit had been filed. Google did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. On Thursday, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to officially rename the Gulf for federal agencies. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office in January. He argued the change was justified because the US ""do most of the work there, and it's ours"". However Sheinbaum's government contends that Trump's order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf. ""All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,"" she said, asserting that the US lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf. In January, Sheinbaum wrote a letter to Google asking the firm to reconsider its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico for US users. The following month, she threatened legal action. At the time, Google said it made the change as part of ""a longstanding practice"" of following name changes when updated by official government sources. It said the Gulf - which is bordered by the US, Cuba and Mexico - would not be changed for people using the app in Mexico, and users elsewhere in the world will see the label: ""Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)"". The Associated Press (AP) news agency's refusal to start referring to the Gulf of America led to a months-long conflict with the White House, which restricted AP's access to certain events. A federal judge ordered the White House in April to stop sidelining the outlet. Trump hinted Wednesday that he may recommend changing the way the US refers to another body of water. During an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, he plans to announce that the US will henceforth refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, AP reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has responded by saying he hopes the ""absurd rumours"" are ""no more than a disinformation campaign"" and such a move would ""bring the wrath of all Iranians"".",2025-05-10
BBC,Business,US and UK agree to deal slashing Trump tariffs on cars and metalsIt will leave a 10% import tax on most goods shipped from the UK to the US. 1 day agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp92r2kvk74o,"The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, as part of a new agreement between the US and UK. The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January. But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK. Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year. No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details. Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a ""fantastic platform"". ""This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,"" he said, adding that the ""the UK has no greater ally than the United States"". At the White House, Trump called it a ""great deal"" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance. ""This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,"" he said.  The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year. That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs. ""This was very serious,"" he said. ""It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough."" Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously. The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative. The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes. Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (£3.8bn) ""opportunity"" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products. ""It can't be understated how important this deal is,"" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said. UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer ""major relief"" to the steel sector. ""The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,"" he said. Other business groups expressed more uncertainty. ""It's better than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,"" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade. ""I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit."" While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US. ""This is not a historic deal with the US,"" she said. ""We've been shafted."" The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show ""complete disrespect to the public"" if MPs were denied a say. Sir Ed Davey said: ""When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail. ""One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK."" Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a ""step in the right direction"". He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development. ""The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,"" he said. ""It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.""  The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time. But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK. It was not clear how much those issues had advanced. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a ""tremendous win"" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes. The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports. While the UK appears to have made some commitments, ""the devil will be in the details,"" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement. Other issues loom. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines. The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms ""preferential treatment"". But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now ""left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean"".",2025-05-10
BBC,Business,What is in the UK-US tariff deal?The two nations have announced a deal to reduce tariffs - here's what you need to know.8 hrs agoBusiness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15ng4g5g0eo,"The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US. But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. Here's an at-a-glance look at what's in the deal. Trump declared on social media this announcement would be a ""major trade deal"" - it's not. He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress. Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on some of Trump's tariffs. This is an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods. It is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement, there will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow. Trump had placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US on top of the existing 2.5%. This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year. But any cars exported above that quota will be subject to a 27.5% import tax. Cars are the UK's biggest export to the US - worth about £9bn last year. Jaguar Land Rover, which exports almost a quarter of its cars to the US,  said the deal ""secures greater certainty for our sector"". But car industry leaders have told the BBC the quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively. The UK currently imposes a 10% levy on US car imports, but it is not clear if there is any change to this. The US has previously demanded the tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves had indicated she is open to such a cut. Trump also announced that Rolls-Royce engines and plane parts will be able to be exported from the UK to the US tariff-free. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US that came into effect in March has been scrapped. This is good news for firms such as British Steel which was brought under government control as it struggled to stay operational. However, the White House said it would impose a quota on the ""most favoured nation rates for UK steel and aluminium and certain derivative steel and aluminium products."" It is currently unclear how much of these products the UK will be able to export to the US under this quota system without paying more. It is also unclear whether the scrapping of tariffs will apply to steel derivative products and whether only steel melted and poured in the UK will benefit. The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, about £700m in total. However, the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, including things such as gym equipment, furniture and machinery. These are worth much more, about £2.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year. Industry body Steel UK said there were ""a number hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal"". It said firms needed to know what supply chain conditions need to be met, what the quotas are and when they take effect. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs. The US said both countries would ""promptly negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals"". Pharmaceuticals are a major export for the UK when it comes to US trade – last year sales of these products were worth £6.6bn making it the UK's second-biggest export to the US. It's also America's fourth biggest export to the UK, valued at £4bn last year. Most countries, including the US, imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, as part of an agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable. The president has not announced any trade restrictions on medicines yet. There was no change to the UK's 2% digital services tax in this deal and it appears to be a sticking point. Businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces have to pay it if they receive more than £500m in global revenues and £25m from UK users annually. But this threshold is easily met by US tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple. The UK reportedly netted nearly £360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year. The UK government said it had ""agreed to work on a digital trade deal"". But the US government said it was ""disappointed that the UK was unwilling to agree to fully address the tax. ""It is discriminatory, unjustified, and should be removed promptly,"" it said. US beef exports to the UK had been subject to a 20% tariff within a quota of 1,000 metric tons. The UK has scrapped this tariff and raised the quota to 13,000 metric tonnes, according to the White House document. In return, the UK has been given the same quota at a lower rate in line with other countries. Crucially, there will be no weakening of UK food standards on imports as part of this deal, the UK government statement said, insisting that American hormone-treated meat will not seep onto the UK market. Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s. The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones. This is an area where the UK has chosen alignment with EU - and the forthcoming ""Brexit reset"" with the EU - over the US. The tariff on ethanol coming into the UK from the US has also been scrapped. The National Farmers Union said the inclusion of ""a significant volume of bioethanol [a renewable fuel made from crops] in the deal raises concerns for British arable farmers"".",2025-05-10
BBC,Business,"Hormone-treated beef will not enter UK after US deal, says governmentFarmers are raising questions over how checks will ensure US beef produced using hormones doesn't enter the UK market.8 hrs agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89pw3j7z9zo,"The government has insisted that American hormone-treated meat will not start to seep into the UK market, following the tariff deal agreed this week that boosts the trade in beef in both directions. Some farmers and consumers have expressed fears that the deal could open the door to beef from cattle raised using hormones to boost their growth. However, the government said certification procedures and border checks would ensure hormone-reared beef would not enter the UK. The National Farmers' Union said it was asking the government to provide more details on how checks would work to ensure safety standards were maintained. ""The rules on food standards have not changed and they will not change as a result of the deal,"" said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones. He added that the agencies responsible for border safety checks would be able to test meat for traces of hormone with ""consequences"" for anyone breaking the law. But Ian McCubbine, a beef farmer in Surrey, said he was concerned about the prospect of more American-grown beef coming into the UK. ""How do we know what they are putting in?"" he said, speaking to the BBC's Today programme. ""We spent 50 years building an industry that is strong on environmental gain and animal welfare. ""The concern is that the US [beef imports] could be of lower quality."" The UK stopped allowing hormone-produced beef in 1989, when the practice was banned across the EU after it declared it unsafe. But many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production. Adding growth hormones makes cows put on muscle mass, and so makes their beef cheaper. The US and other countries that use the method, including Australia, say there is no added health-risk from hormone-treated beef. However, a lot of consumers are wary of it, with some commenting online that they would look out for UK-produced beef in future. As part of the tariff deal the UK has agreed to allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free. That is the equivalent of one medium-sized steak per adult per year. Currently the US exports around 1,000 tonnes to the UK with a 20% tariff, the UK's Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. In exchange, the UK will also be able to sell more beef to the US than it currently does, also up to 13,000 tonnes at a lower tariff than at present. The deal also includes lower tariffs on UK-made cars destined for the US market and US ethanol exports to the UK. Liz Webster, founder of the group Save British Farming, echoed Mr McCubbine's fears in a post on X. ""In exchange for tariff relief on luxury cars, we've opened our doors to US beef and ethanol. But as our border checks are barely functioning, how we'll enforce standards is anyone's guess,"" she wrote. Some X users suggested shoppers should look out for the Red Tractor label, which means meat is produced in the UK. ""I'll be buying from my local butchers who knows the local farmers and which herds the beef comes from,"" said one. US producers must have monitoring and certification procedures in place to prove that they are compliant with UK food standards to be allowed to export, Defra said. Hormones are usually used to fatten cattle in the later stages of production, a Defra spokesperson said, and therefore traces would be identifiable through checks.",2025-05-10

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Molly-Mae confirms she and Tommy are back togetherThe pair announced their split last August, five years after they met on reality series Love Island.10 hrs agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr7lv7pw2po,"Reality TV star Molly-Mae Hague has confirmed she and Tommy Fury are back together, after announcing their split last August. The pair met on the 2019 series of Love Island, later becoming engaged and welcoming their daughter Bambi in 2023. Hague announced their split last year, and suggested in her subsequent docuseries that Fury's drinking had become a problem in the relationship. But in the latest episodes, released on Friday, Hague confirmed they were back together, saying Fury had not drunk alcohol for four months and that ""things are looking so much better"". Hague is the most successful former Love Island contestant, with 8.5 million Instagram followers and her own clothing brand. Speaking in a new episode of her Amazon Prime Video docuseries, Behind It All Part II, Hague described the relationship as ""worth saving"". She added she does not want to rush anything with Fury but to take ""things slow"" as the couple rebuild. ""I love Tommy so much and I love our family so much that I'm willing to ride the wave,"" Hague said. ""And that's not something that everyone wants to do, but it's something that I'm willing to do because I want my family."" She continued: ""Obviously, he knows it's the drink. He's not drank now for what, four months? ""I don't think the drink's gone away forever. Do I think that drink could still be a problem for us, potentially? Yeah, but I think the break-up showed Tommy that I'm serious."" ""He's just really different these days."" The news comes several months after Hague and Fury were seen kissing at a New Year's Eve party. In January, Hague denied their break-up had been a ""publicity stunt"", adding that the situation was ""really complicated"". In the new episodes of her TV series, Hague also spoke about a recent family holiday with Fury and Bambi which Mae described as ""picture perfect"". ""Dubai was picture perfect, like it was just the best trip ever,"" she said. ""It just felt like everything I wanted it to be, and more. It was exactly what we needed. ""All the noise of everyone, just like it just switched off everyone's opinions. Nothing mattered. It was just like us in our bubble."" She added: ""Things are looking so much better for us. I'm gonna start spending more time at Tommy's house, keeping things slow and not rushing anything. ""But, as always, I always say I don't know what the future holds. I don't think it's going to be a plain sailing future. I don't, that's just me being honest. I think we're still going to have bumps. ""The dream is still the same that, you know, we'll get to a place one day when we will all be happy in that house together and have more children, hopefully, and just have a really nice, happy life together. That's all I've ever wanted for us. ""I don't want to get too excited, but I'm getting glimmers of what I always wanted, which is, my family. ""I know that we have got something completely worth saving but you never know what's around the corner."" Fury previously said he was ""heartbroken"" by the split, while Hague said in August she was ""extremely upset"" their relationship had ended. The second instalment of Mae's docuseries follows three episodes which were released in January. Hague was born in Stevenage and grew up in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, while Fury was born and raised in Manchester.

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Why these 2000s indie heroes are back and bigger than everAfter being dismissed as ""indie landfill"", many guitar bands are back with a vengeance after 20 years.23 hrs agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5d04r634go,"""I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself."" Luke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer. Both admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur. ""But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,"" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie. ""It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other."" The Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom – a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump. Over the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts. Angular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day. By 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkeys' incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out. But the party couldn't last forever. In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase ""indie landfill"" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves. Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called ""The Something""? Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal). ""It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,"" says Archer. ""The opportunities dried up in England,"" agrees Pritchard. ""We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more."" ""It got to a point where we were just exhausted,"" Archer continues. ""It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things."" In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld. But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes. ""The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,"" says Archer. The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album. The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences. But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Naïve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok. Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience. How do they explain this sudden revival? ""We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,"" Pritchard observes. ""In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again."" But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse. ""Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,"" agrees Pritchard. ""People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff. ""But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook."" Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for ""almost 365 days"". But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs. ""What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?"" says Archer. A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry. The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 – making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies. Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up. The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise. ""We were never the best friends with the NME,"" laughs Archer. ""Who was?"" asks Pritchard. ""There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out."" Are there any reviews seared into their memories? ""No, I've done a lot of work on that,"" Pritchard jokes. ""But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been."" ""How can you not be, though?"" asks Archer. ""They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over."" While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music. ""I kept it,"" he says, ""so I could get revenge later."" ""You should frame it and put it in the loo,"" Pritchard suggests. ""Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump."" But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman. Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world. ""I don't see the point in being just another indie band,"" he boasted in one interview. ""What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem."" ""You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,"" Pritchard reflects now. ""But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging."" With hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records. Pritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week. ""I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,"" he says. ""So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started -  not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again."" The result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves. Archer is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year. So, have the bands got a five-year plan? ""Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,"" laughs Pritchard. ""I think it's good to have goals!"" ""Do you really?"" asks Archer, with a concerned frown. ""I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.""",2025-05-10
BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Bargain Hunt expert admits terror offence after sales to 'Hezbollah financier'Oghenochuko Ojiri, who has been an expert on the BBC programme, has admitted eight offences.8 hrs agoUK",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdj9wpk2nxjo,"An art expert who has worked on the BBC's Bargain Hunt has admitted failing to report a series of high-value art sales to a man suspected of financing the proscribed group Hezbollah. Oghenochuko Ojiri, 53, pleaded guilty to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000 of failing to make a disclosure during the course of business, the first prosecution of its kind. The court heard on Friday that Ojiri sold artwork worth £140,000 to Nazem Ahmad, who is accused of supporting the Lebanon-based group and was sanctioned by the US in 2019. Lyndon Harris, prosecuting, said Ojiri had read news reports showing Ahmad had been sanctioned and discussed this with other people. The offences took place between October 2020 and December 2021. Ojiri founded Ramp Gallery, now known as the Ojiri Gallery, based in east London. Mr Harris said: ""There is one discussion where Ojiri is party to a conversation where it is apparent a lot of people have known for years about [Ahmad's] terrorism links."" He added that ""Ramp Gallery engaged a third party to advise on compliance matters"" but that the advice given was ""not properly acted on"". Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Ojiri ""dealt with Mr Ahmad directly, negotiated the sales of artwork and congratulated him on purchases"". The prosecution's case claimed that at the time of the transactions, there was a significant amount of online material showing Ahmad's alleged links to the ""blood diamond"" trade - a reference to how diamonds are sometimes used to fund armed conflict and insurgencies. Ahmad was also sanctioned by the UK government in April 2023, which froze his assets and banned UK nationals from doing business with him or his companies. That restriction was imposed on the day Ojiri was arrested. At the time, the UK government said Ahmad had ""an extensive art collection in the UK"" and conducted business ""with multiple UK-based artists, art galleries and auction houses"". Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon and is backed by Iran. It is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. Ojiri, also known as Ochuko Ojiri, was charged following an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's specialist arts and antiques unit, alongside the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) and HMRC. Under the legislation, it is an offence if people do not notify police if they know or suspect a business associate to have been involved in financing a proscribed group. According to the prosecution, Ojiri told police he did not support terrorist activity and was sorry for what he had done. He said he knew who Ahmad was and he denied that money or greed were motivating factors, saying it was more because of the excitement and kudos of dealing with a ""name"" in the collecting world. Ojiri is listed on Bargain Hunt's website as one of the show's experts. He is not a member of BBC staff, works as a freelance presenter and has also appeared on Antiques Road Trip and Channel 5's Storage: Flog the Lot! He has not worked on BBC programmes since 2023. A BBC spokesperson said: ""It would not be appropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings."" District Judge Briony Clarke granted Ojiri bail but ordered him to surrender his passport. Gavin Irwin, mitigating, told the court Ojiri was not a flight risk. He will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 6 June.",2025-05-10

The Sevenoaks-based musician posted a video on social media encouraging fans to ""pull up"" to a free concert on the Margate Steps on Friday at 18:00 BST. But music promoters Margate Summer Series said he had been forced to pull the plug on the impromptu event, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In a public statement, alongside an image labelling the gig postponed, it said: ""Dizzee Rascal will be rescheduled due to filming taking place in Margate today. Hold tight, more news coming soon."" ""Tonight in Margate on the Kings Steps, it's a pull up, don't call it a pop up, I'm coming down there, we're going to have a rave up, yeah?"" the artist had said in a video to his more than half a million Instagram followers. The video gained thousands of views in just hours. Dizzee Rascal, real name Dylan Kwabena Mills, was made an MBE for services to music in 2020. In 2003, aged 19, he became the youngest artist to win the Mercury Prize, with his debut album Boy in da Corner. A graphic promoting the event had been shared by Margate Summer Series – the promoters of Dreamland's summer concerts – saying: ""Bring your friends, your mum, your dad, even your little sister. Everyone's welcome!"" Ward councillor for Margate Central and former mayor of the town Rob Yates said he had emailed Dreamland on seeing the social media posts. ""I think it's an irresponsible ticket stunt,"" he said. The London-born rapper and Mike Skinner of The Streets are set to perform at the Marine Terrace venue on 29 August. Dreamland's operations manager Shane Guy wrote in an email to Yates about the unplanned seafront gig: ""This event is not being organised by Dreamland. ""We have been in contact with the promoter and management team for Dizzee Rascal with a firm request that it be cancelled immediately and that a statement goes out confirming cancellation to all media and social media channels."" Yates said there had been ""no liaison"" with the council. He added: ""It's council land, it's dangerous to hold it right next to the sea, there's no police, medics or planning.""
