BBC,Business,"It's one of the most rowdy US sporting events. Here's what Preakness says about the economyThe Maryland tradition attracts a mix of socioeconomic classes. But this year, the tradition has been thrown into question.8 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk0zq7kg5o,"A woman balancing a dozen cocktails on a tray atop her head inched carefully through the steadily building crowds and chaos on Saturday morning at the Pimlico Race Course clubhouse. ""How much is that,"" a man in purple trousers yelled towards her, the glassware inches above her eyebrow clanking as she paused. ""Twenty dollars,"" she replied. Ray De Rubin repeated the number in disbelief, mumbled an expletive under his breath, then said: ""I'll take two."" He and his mother were at Pimlico for the first time - here to wager on US horse racing's esteemed Preakness Stakes on its 150th anniversary. Just two weeks ago, during his 14th trip to the Kentucky Derby, he won big. ""This is the exact same outfit I wore on Derby day. Same underwear, same socks, same hat,"" he said. ""I still got my Derby wristband on."" His wager at Pimlico? ""I can't tell you. I don't want the IRS coming after me,"" he said with a grin. On the other side of Pimlico – just beyond the thousand-dollar seats, champagne flutes, and air-conditioned tents on the infield – five thoroughbreds idled behind the  starting line. Mr De Rubin had bets on three of them. There was a brief moment of quiet before the race. Then the gates flung open, and the horses took off. Mr De Rubin, eyes fixed on the screens above, stood frozen. But only for a moment. ""I get really loud when I watch the race. I put a lot of work into this,"" he said. One of three annual thoroughbred races - along with the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes - that make up what is known as the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes has long been known as one of the most glamorously bacchanal events in US sports. Held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, it brings together the rowdy and the rich. But this year, its traditions have been thrown into question. In his second term as president, Donald Trump has enforced swift, dramatic economic policy changes, leading to significant consumer pessimism. Virtually no corner of the American market has been spared - from the fast-food hamburger to the Preakness Stakes. Much of the current market-rattling turmoil is a result of Trump's sweeping global tariffs, announced on 2 April. Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", he said the new economic strategy would usher in ""the golden age of America"". Instead, in the 48 hours after his announcement, the S&P 500 had its worst two-day sell-off in years, as trillions of dollars were wiped from the stock market. Three weeks later, the International Monetary Fund warned of a global recession. Even McDonald's reported a drop in sales, which the burger chain's CEO attributed to customers ""grappling with uncertainty"".  But while the stock market has mostly recovered following tariff agreements with the UK and China, the tariffs' impact may be just beginning; mega corporations like Walmart and Amazon recently warned of price increases. But at Pimlico, the state of Maryland is betting big, with plans to demolish the track right after Saturday's event and rebuild a new course in its place, plus a state-of-the-art training facility. The tariffs' shadow looms here, too. ""We expect there to be some kind of impact,"" the Maryland Stadium Authority told the BBC in a statement. But for now, they said the effects on the half-billion dollar project remains unclear. Aside from tariffs, horse race attendance has shrunk in recent years. Just over 46,000 people attended the Preakness in 2024, down from the 131,000 that attended in 2019. The Derby drew a much larger crowd of roughly 150,000 this year but was still well under its peak of 170,000 in 2015. Bill Carstanjen, CEO of the Derby's home, Churchill Downs, said a dip in sales this year was due to buyer ""hesitancy"" that ""correlates perfectly"" with Trump's tariffs. ""We didn't have the endless pool of demand that we've seen in prior years,"" Mr Carstanjen told the Lexington Herald. Still, gambling records this year were broken at the Derby and Preakness. Over a week before the Preakness and before the horses running were finalised, a Preakness record of $348,000 was wagered on betting futures, up from last year's record of $260,000. All just a drop in the bucket compared to the millions that will be wagered by the time the last horse crosses the finish line. University of Kentucky economics professor Justin Balthrop told the BBC that a rise in gambling also could be a sign of economic distress. ""People who reach a certain level of despair will start to take on more risk, in an effort to literally gamble their way back to a place where they feel like they can be more comfortable,"" Professor Balthrop said. ""You combine that with this idea that maybe they are so pessimistic, that this gives them the dopamine rush or endorphin release."" Waiting in a long line on Pimlico's infield, Anthony Walker was among those looking for ""a little reprieve"". He was glad ""to be able to take a few hours away from all that instability"" in the stock market as well as the disruption caused by Trump's downsizing of the federal government. Mr Walker planned to gamble – ""you can't come to the race without putting a little something out there"" – but a bit less than he might have in more certain times. ""I'm wagering 50% less, for sure,"" he estimated. ""Because of what's happening in the economy – the way this administration is taking a wrecking ball to the longstanding traditions and institutions that give credence to the American way of life."" At the Preakness, there are still endless ways to get a quick dose of gambling-induced dopamine. Even for as little as 10 cents. ""I've seen a 10 cent (wager) pay $75,000,"" said Peter Rotondo, who heads racing and wagering for 1/ST, the organisation running Preakness. To do so, one would have to wager on what's called a superfecta: correctly guessing which four horses will place in the top four in the exact order, odds that are about on par with getting struck by lightning. ""That's the beauty of the super,"" Mr Rotondo said. The pricey cocktail Mr De Rubin grumbled about is the Black-Eyed Susan, also Maryland's official flower. The crazed concoction - bourbon, vodka, and a splash of mixers - leaves one to wonder whether it's truly a tribute to the state flower or a wink to the likely black eye after having too many. The drink is one of many traditions at the annual event. There's also the decades-old Tiffany & Co-made trophy called the Woodlawn Vase, considered ""the most valuable trophy in sports"". Made of 30lb of sterling silver, it's valued at an estimated $4m (£3m), and thus is kept in a museum most of the year. The Preakness winner leaves with a replica. But for many, the Preakness wouldn't be the Preakness without the party on the infield. ""I went a lot in my 20s and 30s. It was an absolutely crazy party,"" Bobby Duke, 51, said in an email to the BBC. ""In 1998, a guy jumped the fence and tried to punch a horse while racing. It's on YouTube."" Though Pimlico always had offerings for elegant, fans like Mr Duke fondly remember piling into the infield for ""the most salacious party on the sports calendar"", as ESPN once put it, where patrons would race across a long row of porta-pottys while dodging beer cans hurled at them by inebriated onlookers. (That tradition ended around 2009, when Pimlico stopped its BYOB policy.) Maryland officials said the new Pimlico will become a year-round racing facility, and hopefully bring an economic boost to the low-income Park Heights neighbourhood surrounding it. In his purple pants and every-colour-of-the-rainbow shirt, Mr De Rubin grew agitated as his luck began to unravel during the five-horse race. ""(Horse number five) is dead last. I don't think they're going to catch this,"" he said with growing animation, rattling the ice in his Black-Eyed Susan. He placed bets on horses one, three and five. ""Oh, (crap), the three horse. Here comes the one horse. Come on, one!"" In a span of about three minutes, the anticipation, anxiety, fear and hope all came crashing to an end. Mr De Rubin didn't win. But he didn't lose either. The even spread on the winning horse basically gave him back what he put into it. He compared the experience to today's seesaw stock market. ""Investing, and betting on horses, is gambling. You have ups and downs,"" he said. His stock portfolio has taken a wild downward spin through Trump's global tariff tit-for-tat. But recently it sprang back into the green and is up around 20%, he said. Unlike the horses, ""you can't watch the market. It'll give you a heart attack"", he advised. ""I have faith in Trump. He's a little crazy with it right now, but it'll all work out.""",2025-05-18
BBC,Business,US loses last perfect credit rating amid rising debtMoody's said successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs.1 day agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0xk4ld1o,"The US has lost its last perfect credit rating, as influential ratings firm Moody's expressed concern over the government's ability to pay back its debt. In lowering the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', Moody's noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs. A triple-A rating signifies a country's highest possible credit reliability, and indicates it is considered to be in very good financial health with a strong capacity to repay its debts. Moody's warned in 2023 the US triple-A rating was at risk. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings did so in 2011. Moody's held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917. The downgrade ""reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" Moody's said in the statement. In a statement, the White House said it was ""focused on fixing Biden's mess"", while taking a swipe at Moody's. ""If Moody's had any credibility,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, ""they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded."" A lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt, and generally face higher borrowing costs. Moody's maintained that the US ""retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency"". The firm said it expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year. GDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments, and people in a country. The BBC has reached out to the US Department of Treasury for comment. The downgrade came on the same day as Trump's landmark spending bill suffered a setback in Congress. Trump's so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" failed to pass the House Budget Committee, with some Republicans voting against it. Figures showed the US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs. The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",2025-05-18
BBC,Business,Doom: One of gaming's oldest series reckons with the challenges of 2025Doom is one of the most well-known series in gaming but it still has to work to find new players.1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gezq2q911o,"Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom. First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry. But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025. Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles. BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges. While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face. ""There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,"" says executive producer Marty Stratton. Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts. There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as ""forever games"". In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P. Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher. Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can ""fit into those habits"". ""It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,"" he says. The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase. But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players. Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is. ""The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,"" he says. One way of doing this is by attracting new players. Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new ""Medieval sci-fi"" setting and altered gameplay style. ""We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,"" he says. The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages. ""In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,"" says Hugo. But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry. The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years. In 2010, a new game cost roughly £40 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time. If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about £60 in today's money. Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs £69.99 for a standard edition or almost £100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included. ""When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,"" says Marty. The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers. That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players. But Doom producer Marty argues that ""free"" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are ""no unknown expenses"" with a one-off purchase such as Doom. ""You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,"" he says. F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from ""microtransactions"" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds. Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about £22 a month on those transactions. That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a ""curated experience"" with ""replay value"". ""Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,"" he says. Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more ""fiddling with prices"" and surcharges ""to see what customers are willing to pay"" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases. ""Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,"" he says. Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at £14.99 a month. There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price. Game Pass players could pay a £34.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content. Rhys says we are likely to see more of these sorts of offers are aimed at ""superfans"" who want to keep up with the latest releases. For everyone else, waiting is an option. ""You can pick up the first 2016 Doom game for like £4 right now,"" says Rhys. Doom's makers, perhaps unsurprisingly, believe their latest is worth jumping into. ""We think about price when we're developing it - we obviously want the value to be there for players,"" says Marty. ""Ultimately, it's a market. Players will determine what they want to spend."" ""I think it's there's obviously still a place for a good, premium, highly polished, fun single-player game,"" adds Hugo.

BBC,Business,"US proposes dropping Boeing criminal charge Families criticised the move, which would avoid a trial that is due to begin in June.2 days agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0lpqpyro,"US prosecutors may drop a criminal charge against the aerospace giant Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling aircraft, the 737 Max. In an online meeting with relatives of those who died in the two accidents, officials for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case. The move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge that is due to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement in which Boeing had agreed to plead guilty. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the new plan. ""While DOJ claims no final decision has been made, their scripted presentation made it clear that the outcome has already been decided,"" said Erin Applebaum, a partner at Kreindler and Kreindler, which represents 34 families of those killed in the Ethiopian crash. ""Boeing has never stood trial for the 346 lives lost due to its admitted crimes. Now, DOJ is prepared to let the company walk away, again, with no more than a financial penalty,"" she added.  Boeing currently faces a criminal fraud conspiracy charge, brought in the aftermath of two major 737 Max accidents in late 2018 off Indonesia and in Ethiopia in early 2019. The crashes, which killed 346 people, were blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software, which the pilots were not aware had been fitted to the aircraft. The Department of Justice subsequently accused Boeing of deliberately concealing vital information about the system from regulators, charging the firm with fraud. The firm admitted to the allegations but initially avoided prosecution by paying $2.5bn in fines and compensation and pledging to improve safety standards and compliance programmes. The case was reopened last year, after an incident in which an unused door fell off a 737 Max early in flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft. The DOJ  accused Boeing of having breached the terms of the original settlement. Last year, during the Biden administration, a new deal was reached with prosecutors under which Boeing would plead guilty to the fraud charge, pay a further fine of $243m and agree to a court-appointed monitor overseeing its operations for a set period. But the agreement was rejected in December by a US district court judge overseeing the case, due in part to concerns over how the monitor would be selected. The ruling meant the case would extend into the Trump administration, which has promised to take a lighter regulatory approach. It is understood that Boeing has since sought to withdraw its guilty plea. Boeing declined to comment on Friday. The Department of Justice did not respond. A non-prosecution agreement would not involve admitting to criminal charges. That would spare Boeing from a criminal record, a black mark that would complicate its dealings as a contractor for the government. The case is currently due to go to trial on 23 June.",2025-05-18
BBC,Business,"Why youth mobility and fishing are key issues ahead of UK-EU summitYouth mobility and fishing rights are key negotiating points between the UK and the EU as PM Keir Starmer attempts a post-Brexit ""reset"".1 day ago",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxykl7kypno,"The right of young people to move freely between the UK and EU has emerged as a key negotiating point - along with fishing rights - ahead of a summit in London which the prime minister hopes will ""reset"" relations between the two sides. Before Brexit, people were allowed to come and go under ""freedom of movement"" rules. The EU would like a new ""youth mobility scheme"" but there are concerns about what impact this might have on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are another potential sticking point with the EU calling for an extension of the current post-Brexit deal, but UK fishing groups calling for changes to it. BBC Verify has been examining both issues and why they are important. Since Brexit, UK and EU citizens no longer have an automatic right to live, work, or study in each other's countries. To come to the UK for an extended period, EU nationals usually need specific visas - many of which require a sponsor. Following these new rules, there has been a significant drop in the number of EU students coming to the UK. The UK does have an existing Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) which allows young adults to live, work and study in the UK for up to two years. People from specific countries can apply but not from EU ones. They have to pay an application fee, the health surcharge, and have at least £2,530 in savings. Unlike most other visa schemes, the YMS does not require sponsorship. Last year, just over 24,000 YMS visas were issued - Australians were the largest single group, followed by New Zealanders and Canadians. Just over a year ago, the EU proposed a ""youth mobility scheme"" for EU and UK citizens (aged 18 to 30), allowing stays of up to four years. The idea was rejected by the-then Conservative government. It it is politically sensitive, given Sir Keir Starmer's pledge to ""significantly"" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has warned against ""backsliding on freedom of movement"". Documents circulated between EU states suggested any deal could be rebranded as a ""youth experience"" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration. Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a UK/EU youth mobility scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive. However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal. ""If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang, all come at once,"" she said. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap. Another consideration, Ms Sumption points out, is how many people would go home when their temporary visa comes to an end. ""Even on temporary visas, people do stay. They get a job offer and end up getting a skilled visa through their employer"", she says. The Oxford Migration Observatory says about 10% of people who arrived on temporary worker visas in 2014 from Australia, Canada and New Zealand remained in the UK at the end of 2023. Fishing is another sensitive subject. The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights - who gets to fish where - expires at the end of June 2026. Several EU countries, including France, are asking the UK for concessions, in return for the things the UK wants from the summit. They are pushing for a long-term extension of the current arrangements, agreed in 2020. Fishing only accounts for an estimated 0.4% of UK GDP but it was a big issue in the Brexit campaign and promises were made that the UK would become an ""independent coastal state"". Under the Brexit deal in 2020 however, EU boats were given continued access to UK waters. In 2023, UK vessels landed 719,000 tonnes of fish - an increase of 14% compared to 2019. However, this growth has been driven by Scottish catches, while English fishing boats have seen a fall in their landings. This is linked to the way in which fish quotas were divided up after Brexit, benefitting some areas. At the same time, it has become harder for the UK to export fish to the EU due to post-Brexit paperwork and checks. In 2023, the UK exported 235,606 tonnes of fish to the EU. That's down 29% compared to the 2019 figure of 333,403 tonnes. Chris Ranford, Chief Executive of the Cornish Fish Producers' Organisation (CFPO), represents 175 member vessels and says nothing much has changed, since BBC Verify last spoke to him in 2022. He says French vessels are still fishing off the Cornish coast: ""Very modern, very high-powered French fishing vessels that have much greater catching capacity than the UK or Cornish boats come up to the six-mile line. We don't have space to fish."" For him, the number one priority for any future fishing deal is to stop EU vessels entering the stretch of coastal water that lies between six and 12 nautical miles offshore. France has reportedly called for continued access to UK waters for its fishing boats, in exchange for a defence deal the UK is pushing for. We asked the Maritime Fisheries Committee for Northern France for comment. Another area of improvement Mr Ranford is calling for is easier access to EU markets. ""Our small to medium-sized businesses can't afford to do the extra paperwork to get the fish to the EU market,"" he said. Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, says: ""The market access to the EU has become more bureaucratic."" She says she is disappointed with the five-year fishing deal the UK signed up to. ""Our position approaching the EU reset… is that the access to each other's waters would be on the basis of annual discussions"". ""By having that lever around access, the UK could secure a much fairer share of the resources in our own waters."" There are strong opinions on both sides on fishing and youth mobility. If the UK is to get what it wants from the summit, including easing the trade in agricultural goods between the UK and the EU, there will have to be some give and take in the coming days.

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Eurovision 2025: Austria wins with last-minute vote, as the UK comes 19thAustrian counter-tenor JJ wins with Wasted Love, but the UK gets zero points from the public.9 hrs agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15nq75274qo,"Austrian singer JJ has won the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland, after a nail-biting finish that saw him topple Israel from pole position at the very last minute. The 24-year-old, who is a counter-tenor at the Vienna State Opera, took the title with the song Wasted Love, a tempestuous electro-ballad about unrequited love. ""Thank you so much for making my dreams come true,"" he said as he accepted the coveted glass microphone trophy. ""Love is the strongest force in the world, let's spread more love."" The singer scored 436 points, with Israel in second place on 357 and Estonia third on 356. The UK's act, Remember Monday, placed 19th with 88 points. For the second year in a row, the UK received zero from the public. JJ's younger sister broke through security guards to hug him after his victory was announced. The Austrian said his whole family had arrived to support him at the contest, including his 85-year-old grandfather, and a four-month-old niece, who watched outside with his brother. It is the third time Austria has won the contest, with previous victories going to Udo Jürgens' Merci, Cherie in 1966; and Conchita Wurst with Rise Like a Phoenix in 2014. JJ was inspired to take part in Eurovision by Conchita. The singer had always been one of the favourites to win, but the most hotly-tipped contestants were Sweden's KAJ - whose tongue-in-cheek ode to sauna culture, Bara Bada Bastu, ultimately took fourth place. Speaking after the show, JJ said he was ""so pleased"" that viewers had connected with his story of heartache. ""I wanted to let them have an insight on my deepest soul [and] how I felt when we wrote the song."" ""What I'm trying to commit [to] is that there's no wasted love. There's so much love that we can spread around. It's the strongest force on planet earth."" Asked how he would celebrate, he replied: ""Honestly, I need to sleep now. I'm tired."" For the second year in a row, there was controversy over Israel's participation, with protestors arguing for the country's dismissal over its military action in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protests took place on the streets of Basel in the hours before the contest. Later, a man and a woman were prevented from invading the stage during Israel's performance. ""One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit,"" said Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR in a statement to the BBC. ""The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. ""The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police."" The performance, by young singer Yuval Raphael, was unaffected. The 25-year-old is a survivor of the Hamas attacks of 7 October, 2023, an experience which coloured her delicate ballad, New Day Will Rise. The Israeli delegation said Raphael was left ""shaken and upset"" by the incident, but that it was ""extremely proud"" of her performance ""which represented Israel in a respectful manner"". Elsewhere, Eurovision was its usual explosion of high camp, sexual innuendo and dresses being removed to reveal smaller, tighter dresses. Malta's Mariana Conte was forced to rewrite her disco anthem Serving Kant to remove what sounded like a swear word - but performed the censored version with a knowing wink, safe in the knowledge the audience would fill in the blanks. Although it was a fan favourite, Conte could only manage 17th. Estonia's Tommy Cash, who came third, also kept the innuendo train running, with Espresso Macchiato, a caffeinated disco anthem featuring the unforgettable phrase: ""Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it."" Another highlight was Finland's Erika Vikman, who dispensed with double entendres entirely on Ich Komme, a vibrant hymn to sexual pleasure. The singer ended her performance by taking flight on a giant phallic microphone that shot sparks into the air. It thrust her into 11th position, and a permanent place in the Eurovision pantheon.  The contest also dealt with more weighty subjects like economic migration (Portuguese rock band Napa) and environmental catastrophe (Latvia's Tautumeitas, who scored 12 points from the UK jury). Dutch singer Claude delivered a heartfelt tribute to his mother in C'est La Vie - an upbeat anthem that reflected on her positivity as she uprooted the family from their home country of the Democratic Republic of Congo as a child. In a touching climax, the 21-year-old danced with an image of his childhood self in a mirror on the stage.  Also reflecting on their childhood was French singer Louane, whose tearjerking ballad was dedicated to her mother, who died of cancer when she was 17. In one of the night's most striking performances, she was surrounded by a whirlwind of sand as she hollered the word ""mother"" over and over again. One of the favourites to win, it ended the night in seventh place, after receiving a disappointing 50 points from the public. JJ's performance was similarly dramatic. Shot entirely in black and white, it saw him being tossed around on a rickety boat, as waves (of emotion) threatened to consume him. An honourable mention also goes to Italy's Lucio Corsi, whose harmonica solo in Volevo Essere Un Duro marked the first time a live instrument has been played at Eurovision since 1998. The UK spent a third year in the bottom half of the leaderboard, despite a spirited performance from girl group Remember Monday. A group of friends who met at high school, their inventive pop song What The Hell Just Happened? drew on their many years of experience in West End theatre. The girls pulled off their tricky three-part harmonies while dancing around a fallen chandelier, but the performance didn't connect with voters. Despite earning a healthy 88 points from juries - including 12 from Italy -  it bombed with viewers. They ended in 19th place, one below last year's entrant Olly Alexander. The group laughed off their ""nul points"" score from the public, holding up peace signs and hugging each other as the score was announced. The voting was utter chaos. Thirteen of the 26 finalists received the maximum of 12 points from at least one jury, leaving the competition completely open before the public vote was counted. Israel, who had been languishing in the bottom half of the table, then received 297 points from the public (out of a possible maximum of 444). Twelve of those points came from the UK. For a while, it looked like Yuval Raphael's lead might be unassailable - but Austria's tally of 178 was the last to be announced, leaving the singer empty-handed. And spare a thought for Switzerland. Their contestant, Zoë Më, was in second place after the jury vote, with 214 points. Then the public gave her the night's only other zero-point score. To gasps in the arena, her song Voyage was demoted to 10th place. There was disappointment, too, for fans of Canadian singer Céline Dion, who had been rumoured to appear at the contest. The singer won Eurovision for Switzerland in 1988, and had appeared in a video wishing the contestants good luck at Tuesday's semi-final. Despite hopes from Eurovision organisers that she might turn up, the moment never came to pass. ",2025-05-18
BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Elton brands government 'losers' over AI copyright plansThe musician accuses the government of robbing young artists over its copyright law plans.3 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jg0348yvxo,"Sir Elton John described the government as ""absolute losers"" and said he feels ""incredibly betrayed"" over plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws. Speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said if ministers go ahead with plans to allow AI firms to use artists' content without paying, they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"". This week the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes. A government spokesperson said that ""no changes"" to copyright laws would be ""considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators"". Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. Sir Elton said the ""danger"" is that, for young artists, ""they haven't got the resources ... to fight big tech [firms]"". ""It's criminal, in that I feel incredibly betrayed,"" he added. ""The House of Lords did a vote, and it was more than two to one in our favour,"" he said. ""The government just looked at it as if to say, 'Hmm, well the old people ... like me can afford it.'"" On Monday, the House of Lords voted by a 147 majority to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to add transparency requirements, which aim to ensure copyright holders have to give permission for their work to be used. But on Wednesday MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject this change, meaning the bill will continue to go back and forth between the two Houses until they reach an agreement on it. Sir Elton warned the government was on course to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"", adding that he thought the government was ""just being absolute losers, and I'm very angry about it"". The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to ""wise up"" and described Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as ""a bit of a moron"". He said if the government does not change its plans, he would be ready to take ministers to court, saying that ""we'll fight it all the way"". Speaking alongside the 78-year-old, playwright James Graham said ministers ""do understand the value of creativity... but what's frustrating is either the complacency or the willingness to let Silicon Valley tech bros get it all their own way"". The chief executive of UK music, Tom Kiehl, told the BBC that the government is ""on the brink"" of offering up the country's music industry ""as a sacrificial lamb in its efforts to cosy up to American-based tech giants"". He added that the prime minister ""must not sell"" the next generation of singers, songwriters, musicians, and music creators ""down the river and allow all that talent to be crushed by letting soulless AI bots plunder their work"". Ahead of the vote in the House of Lords, Sir Elton joined more than 400 British musicians, writers, and artists in signing a letter calling on the prime minister to update copyright laws in a way that protects them from artificial intelligence. Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney, who also signed the letter, previously told the BBC there was a risk AI would create a ""Wild West"" in which artists' copyright was not properly protected. A government spokesperson said it wants the UK's creative industries and AI companies to ""flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors"". The spokesperson said it was ""vital"" the government worked through responses to a consultation on proposals to allow developers to use creators' content unless rights holders elected to ""opt out"". They added that it was ""equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps"". ""That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment - exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.""

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Doom: One of gaming's oldest series reckons with the challenges of 2025Doom is one of the most well-known series in gaming but it still has to work to find new players.1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gezq2q911o,"Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom. First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry. But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025. Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles. BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges. While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face. ""There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,"" says executive producer Marty Stratton. Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts. There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as ""forever games"". In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P. Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher. Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can ""fit into those habits"". ""It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,"" he says. The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase. But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players. Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is. ""The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,"" he says. One way of doing this is by attracting new players. Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new ""Medieval sci-fi"" setting and altered gameplay style. ""We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,"" he says. The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages. ""In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,"" says Hugo. But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry. The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years. In 2010, a new game cost roughly £40 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time. If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about £60 in today's money. Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs £69.99 for a standard edition or almost £100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included. ""When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,"" says Marty. The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers. That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players. But Doom producer Marty argues that ""free"" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are ""no unknown expenses"" with a one-off purchase such as Doom. ""You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,"" he says. F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from ""microtransactions"" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds. Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about £22 a month on those transactions. That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a ""curated experience"" with ""replay value"". ""Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,"" he says. Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more ""fiddling with prices"" and surcharges ""to see what customers are willing to pay"" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases. ""Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,"" he says. Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at £14.99 a month. There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price. Game Pass players could pay a £34.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content. Rhys says we are likely to see more of these sorts of offers are aimed at ""superfans"" who want to keep up with the latest releases. For everyone else, waiting is an option. ""You can pick up the first 2016 Doom game for like £4 right now,"" says Rhys. Doom's makers, perhaps unsurprisingly, believe their latest is worth jumping into. ""We think about price when we're developing it - we obviously want the value to be there for players,"" says Marty. ""Ultimately, it's a market. Players will determine what they want to spend."" ""I think it's there's obviously still a place for a good, premium, highly polished, fun single-player game,"" adds Hugo.

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Mexico accuses MrBeast of exploiting Mayan pyramidsAuthorities say they never allowed Jimmy Donaldson to film at pyramid heritage sites for profit.1 day agoLatin America,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr70vykk0wo,"Mexico is seeking compensation from the producers of a MrBeast video and has accused the US YouTuber of exploiting its ancient pyramids for commercial gain. The video ""I Explored 2000 Year Old Ancient Temples"" shows the influencer, real name Jimmy Donaldson, 27, and his team exploring ancient Mayan cities, with a permit. But in one part of the video produced by Full Circle Media, which has received more than 60 million views in a  week, MrBeast advertises a  chocolate product as a ""Mayan dessert"" and urges viewers to buy it. Authorities said that while they had granted permission to film at the sites, they had not permitted for-profit use. A MrBeast representative denied some of the accusations. The spokesperson told the BBC: ""No advertisement material was shot on any archaeological sites overseen by INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History)."" In the video, the scene promoting the chocolate snack appears to be filmed at the influencer's camping site. The spokesperson also said the video was ""meant to highlight these treasured Mayan sites in Mexico"" and that it was ""unfortunate that this has turned into a political issue - hopefully it can lead to a productive dialogue and encourages people to visit these unique historical treasures"". Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday called for an investigation into the conditions under which the filming permit had been granted. In the video's caption, MrBeast thanks Mexican tourism and government authorities for permission to film in the sites, while also plugging links to his chocolate product. The video shows him and his team exploring areas of restricted access in the Mayan cities of Calakmul and Chichén Itzá. At one point he says ""I can't believe the government's letting us do this."" They are also shown appearing to descend into a pyramid from a helicopter and in another scene are shown handling an ancient pre-Hispanic mask. But heritage authorities said these were ""false assertions"" and accused the YouTuber of presenting misinformation. INAH said MrBeast had never held a real pre-Hispanic mask and there appeared to have been extensive post-production editing in the video - such as the helicopter scene. ""All of these are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the YouTuber in question,"" its statement on Monday read. Mexico's Secretary of Culture Claudia Curiel de Icaza said on Thursday that, although they had authorised the permit for MrBeast to film, they had never authorised the publication of false information or the use of heritage site images for trademark advertising.

She added that, although Mexico was open to content that contributes to the ""knowledge and dissemination of Mexico's archaeological and cultural heritage"" it was firmly against those who ""take advantage of the willingness of institutions"".

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Rushdie attacker sentenced to 25 years in prisonSir Salman was on a New York lecture stage, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck leaving him partially blinded.2 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85kg527p9o,"A New Jersey man who stabbed and partially blinded novelist Sir Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Friday. Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted of attempted murder and assault earlier this year. Sir Salman was on stage speaking before an audience in August 2022, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck. The attack left him blind in one eye, with damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm. The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. Matar received the maximum 25-year sentence for the attempted murder of Sir Salman. He was also found guilty of assault for wounding the person who was interviewing Sir Salman, Henry Reese, and sentenced to seven years plus three years post-release for that assault. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said on Friday. Before being sentenced, Matar stood and made a statement about freedom of speech in which he called Rushdie a hypocrite, according to the Associated Press. ""Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people,"" said Matar, clad in white-striped jail clothing and wearing handcuffs. ""He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don't agree with that."" Sir Salman was not in the court for his assailant's sentencing on Friday. Matar was convicted of attempted murder and assault in February, 2025, following an intense trial during which Sir Salman detailed the moment when he felt certain that he was going to die. During the two-week trial, he testified that he saw a man rushing towards him while on stage at the historic arts institute in Chautauqua, New York. He said his assailant's eyes ""were dark and seemed very ferocious"". Sir Salman told the court he initially did not realise he had been stabbed, thinking instead that he had been punched. Matar stabbed Sir Salman 15 times in total including to his cheek, chest, eye, neck and thigh. Prosecutors argued that the attack was targeted. ""There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,"" prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt then told the jury. Defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan had argued that prosecutors failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman. Matar, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify in his defence. His lawyers did not call any witnesses of their own. ""I don't think he's a very good person,"" Matar said about the author in a 2022 New York Post story. ""He's someone who attacked Islam."" Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution. The attack took place some 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses was published. The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous. Sir Salman faced countless death threats and was forced into hiding for nine years after Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for the author's death due to the book. But in recent years, the author said he believed the threats against him had diminished. Just before the attack Sir Salman told a German magazine he felt his life was ""relatively normal"". The British-Indian novelist later detailed his experience and long road to recovery in a memoir called Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.",2025-05-18
