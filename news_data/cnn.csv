CNN,Business,Inside Trump’s negotiating strategy with China,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/business/china-trade-negotiations,"A few hours after President Donald Trump’s trade negotiating team boarded a flight for the most important economic meetings in the world, their boss took to social media to publicly throw a curveball into the negotiations. That was the point – not necessarily the path. Trump’s decision to float the possibility of cutting his 145% tariffs on China to 80% gave the impression that Trump was negotiating with himself before the discussions started. But the substance of the message, was not a surprise to his top negotiators, who have discussed the possibility of lowering America’s tariff on China in internal discussions ahead of the US-China talks in Geneva, Switzerland. But it was certainly news to Chinese officials. Trump’s feigned deference to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who he said in the post would make any final decision, was intended to elevate “Scott B” in the eyes of his Chinese counterparts. In reality, US officials are clear-eyed about the fact it will be Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping who will ultimately need to cement any major agreement. Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer landed in Geneva, Switzerland, for two days of meetings with top Chinese officials eyeing what may be viewed as less ambitious, but no less important, outcomes. White House officials have made clear they view the China talks on a separate track than the furious scramble to secure trade agreements with dozens of other nations. Those negotiations are officially on the clock after Trump’s decision to pause the April 2nd “reciprocal” tariff rates for 90 days. Trump’s advisors have framed some of those bilateral negotiations as another lever to exert pressure on China’s economy, with a specific focus on securing early agreements with Indo-Pacific countries including South Korea and Japan. The White House approach to China is defined in its nascent stages as an altogether different approach separate and apart from the roughly 20 prioritized negotiations under way. Administration officials have framed a process intended to start with mutual steps toward de-escalation, followed by demands for specific moves by China to address Trump’s priorities, such as the facilitation of fentanyl production and resuscitating the first term US-China “Phase One” trade deal. Those steps would set the stage for more expansive discussions about the broader trade and economic relationship between the two nations. “This talk is about: Can we get to a stable place and maybe that’s a foundation for something more,” Greer said Thursday in an interview with CNBC. More immediate US concerns over export controls placed by China on rare earths may also drive potential early-stage agreements, but any kind of wide-ranging agreement is at best a long-term process. Unless, of course, Trump decides otherwise. Current and former administration economic advisors preface most conversations about negotiations with some variation of the fact Trump is the wild card that may decide to change course at any time. But Trump’s advisers are using this weekend’s meeting to forge a path out of a persistent and dangerous state of paralysis. They’ve seen positive signals in the lead up to talks that, after a monthslong stare own, came together in a familiar and deeply choreographed way. Both sides announced the scheduled meetings in a roughly coordinated fashion. Both sides insisted their top negotiators just happened to be passing through a city that has long served as a neutral third-country site for the most contentious diplomatic relationships. Both sides have generally maintained their public red lines that would seem to ensure little progress, while also messaging a new degree of flexibility through associated outlets. The officials set to lead the talks from both sides are the most tangible sign that the talks are serious and designed to substantively move toward de-escalation. He Lifeng, Xi’s top economic official and a long member of the Chinese leader’s inner circle, will lead the Chinese delegation. Wang Xiaohong, Xi’s top security aide, was also expected to attend, according to two people familiar with matter. Greer, who has engaged with most of the trade and economic officials expected to attend the meetings during his time across Trump’s first and second terms, said the manifest represented “folks who are serious.” “They’re sending real people to talk to us about real issues, so I’m confident that we can have a straightforward and candid discussion with these folks,” Greer said on CNBC. Bessent has become the public face of Trump’s economic team. Greer, a senior trade official in Trump’s first term who has played an increasingly central role within Trump’s economic team since his February Senate confirmation, brings a similar level of gravitas for the US side. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who spoke to Bessent and Greer shortly before they boarded their flight Thursday evening, told reporters at the White House there have been “very promising signs” from the China side ahead of the meetings. He called the lead up the meeting an environment both sides have approached with “respect, collegiality and sketches of positive developments.” That baseline level of professional diplomacy is a stark shift from the first month of Trump’s second term, where Chinese officials tried in vain to connect with US counterparts and inner circle advisors, according to several people familiar with the matter. That left Chinese officials in a state of “frustration and confusion,” according to a European diplomat briefed on the matter. What soon became clear, the diplomat said, was how serious Trump was about completely re-orienting the bilateral relationship – and that his method would be economic force. China’s retaliation, which Trump and his advisors warned against, didn’t come as a surprise. But it did deepen a rupture in the relationship that threatens the global economy and has already created significant stress on the domestic economies of both nations. US officials have made clear publicly – and maintain privately – that the Chinese economy simply can’t sustain a drawn out trade war with the United States. They’ve been bolstered in that view by recent economic data they say underscores a combination of existing fragility in the country’s economic system and the acute risk posed by a de facto trade embargo with the world’s largest economy. The American officials pointed to quiet outreach from Chinese officials that sparked the planning for the meeting, with a top Xi security advisor communicating a desire to work toward addressing Trump’s major problems on the fentanyl issue. Trump’s fixation with Xi and a potential sweeping economic deal has been a prominent public feature of his first and second terms in the White House, often to the chagrin of his most hardline advisors. They view his overarching assessment of China as clear-eyed and focused on mitigating economic and security vulnerabilities. But there are no shortage of very specific examples of his willingness to break from any kind of linear hawkish approach. The pursuit of a grand economic deal may tempt him once again. “It’s his white whale,” a first-term Trump White House official told CNN. “Think of it like his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize – a huge China deal is the economic version of that.”",2025-05-10
CNN,Business,Why prediction markets failed to see the American pope coming,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/business/online-betting-markets-failed-pope,"The wisdom of crowds is no match for the whims of the Holy Spirit. This week, the ascension of the first American pope surprised many, including the theoretically neutral online betting sites Polymarket and Kalshi. The sites, which allow people to wager on the outcomes of various events, brand themselves as “prediction markets” on the theory that when there’s money on the line, they are better, in aggregate, at anticipating results. While they’ve had some successes — notably, they bested traditional polls at predicting Donald Trump’s 2024 election win — the market for betting on the next pope was blindsided by the conclave’s election of Chicago native Robert Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV. Before the white smoke went up, Kalshi and Polymarket both cast Prevost as a long shot, with odds between 1% and 2%, which means a handful of gamblers who bet on Prevost won big. On Polymarket, one user turned a bet of a little over $1,000 into a $63,683 profit, according to the site’s public ledger. Related article
How prediction markets saw something the polls and pundits didn’t Betting markets allow you to wager on just about anything and have a mixed record of “predicting” outcomes. While they called the 2024 election correctly, they notably fumbled in 2016, when the “smart money” suggested British voters would reject “Brexit” and that Hillary Clinton would defeat Donald Trump. The conclave markets’ big miss this week reflects the limits of their predictive powers. In sports betting, you’ve got thousands of data points about individual athletes, team stats going back decades and any number of informed opinions from professional commentators. Political winds can be volatile, but polling and voter data are practically endless at the national level. In pope betting, the data are far more scarce. “The papal conclave markets are one of the ones that you’d expect to be the least well-calibrated since they only get a data point every decade or two,” Eric Zitzewitz, professor of economics at Dartmouth College, told CNN. “And the process is much more opaque than almost any other political selection process… No tell-all memoirs, even well after the fact.” Plenty of academics and journalists offered insights into who might be among the favorites based on their various CVs and reputations in the church. Pietro Parolin and Luis Antonio Tagle were among the favorites heading into the conclave on Wednesday. And, as election forecaster Nate Silver noted Friday, Parolin’s chances shot up as the white smoke emerged, “presumably on the assumption that the quick decision was good news for the frontrunners.” Of course, the dynamics inside the Sistine Chapel were impossible for market participants to gauge from the outside. All any of us regular people could do was watch “Conclave” and, based on the movie, assume there’s plenty of drama and shifting allegiances. Bottom line: Even in a highly liquid market, which crowd-wisdom theory holds should be more accurate, there are simply no tools to measure what Catholics believe is the spirit of God guiding the cardinals’ choice. “The Holy Spirit is indeed a wily one,” Zitzewitz said.",2025-05-10
CNN,Business,Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/business/trumps-trade-deal-luxury-cars-rolls-royce-bentley-jaguar,"Even as President Donald Trump pushes a message of self-sacrifice when it comes to how many dolls American children should own, his administration’s first trade “deal” includes a carveout for cars – luxury ones. Trump on Thursday hailed the fact that the US-UK framework for trade talks calls for lowering tariffs on UK cars, saying it wasn’t his intention to persuade “super-luxury” brands including Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar to build cars in the United States. According to a fact sheet shared by the White House, the Trump administration has already agreed to lower tariffs on the first 100,000 UK vehicles imported into the United States each year to 10%. Additional vehicles face a 25% tariff. “We took it from 25 to 10 on Rolls-Royce because Rolls-Royce is not gonna be built here. I wouldn’t even ask them to do that. You know, it’s a very special car and it’s a very limited number too,” Trump said, announcing the agreement with Britain in the Oval Office. During the same event, Trump floated slapping a 100% tariff on toys made by Mattel and attacked the company’s CEO after the Barbie and Hot Wheels maker said its toys couldn’t be manufactured in America and still be sold at affordable prices. The United Kingdom exported only about 90,000 cars to the United States last year, according to S&P Global Mobility, making it the sixth-largest source of imported vehicles, responsible for only 1% of imported cars. US Commerce Department data showed that the value of cars imported from the UK came to $12.3 billion, meaning that the average price of a British import was more than $135,000. “It’s not… one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super-luxury and that includes Bentley and Jaguar… some very special cars,” Trump said. “That’s really… handmade stuff and they’ve been doing it for a long time in the same location,” he added, noting that he wanted to help the makers of such cars. Other luxury British car brands that could benefit from the lowered tariffs include Land Rover, Aston Martin and Mini. That means Trump has made it cheaper to import cars that relatively few Americans buy – or, for that matter, can afford – while keeping tariffs for now on more popular and affordable brands, mostly imported from countries other than the UK. “Laser focused on reducing prices for everyday Americans from Day One,” University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers posted on X, “the President has struck a deal that will lower the price of Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Jaguars, Aston Martin’s, Range Rovers and Minis.” Wolfers noted that “no other consumer good received carveouts” from the US-UK trade framework. Meanwhile, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said it’s unlikely Trump’s tariffs will cause toy manufacturing to come to America. “We don’t see that happening,” the Mattel CEO told CNBC after the company warned that tariffs will increase toy prices for American consumers. ﻿Trump fired back, saying: “We’ll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that’s their biggest market.” Trump added: “I wouldn’t wanna have him as an executive too long.” Of course, a 100% tariff on America’s leading toy company would likely cause an even bigger jump in toy prices charged to US consumers. It could also make it very difficult or virtually impossible for parents to buy new Barbies and other toys. Retailers typically start stocking up over the summer for the holiday shopping season. Ken Griffin, the hedge fund billionaire who backed Trump in the 2024 election, told CNBC this week that tariffs are a “painfully regressive tax” that will “hit the pocketbook of hardworking Americans the hardest.” In an interview with Politico, Griffin added that “tariffs open the door to crony capitalism,” with the government picking winners and losers. “I thought this would play out over the course of years. It’s terrifying to watch this play out over the course of weeks,” he said. CNN’s Maria Sole Campinoti contributed to this report.",2025-05-10
CNN,Business,Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/business/trumps-uk-trade-deal-nightcap,"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. OK, so! After a month of negotiations, we finally have a “full and comprehensive” trade agreement with our old pals across the pond. Huge news! What a relief, right? Pop the champagne, the trade war nightmare is almost over… What’s that? What’s in it, you ask? Like, what is the “deal” part of the deal? OK, so it’s more of a concept of a deal. If a trade deal is, like, Michelangelo’s David, this is more like a block of marble. Or really it’s like a receipt from the marble guy that says we’ve placed an order for a block of marble. Maybe put the champagne back in the fridge. Here is what the US and the UK announced Thursday: President Donald Trump’s team took the US tax on British imports from 10% to *checks notes* 10%. Yes, it is the exact same tariff rate that Trump announced on April 2, but with some fun new carve-outs: That’s honestly it — there are no more details, as both sides said specifics are still being ironed out. It’s not all that surprising, given that traditionally trade deals require months or even years of painstaking talks. “A trade agreement where the details are still being negotiated is not an agreement,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, on social media. “This does not provide the clarity necessary to lift the fog of uncertainty created by a trade war of choice.” To hear the White House announce it on Thursday, though, you’d think they just won a Nobel prize and a gold medal. In a Truth Social post, Trump said it was “a very big and exciting day.” Related article
One trade ‘deal’ done, 199 to go UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it “historic” with what sounded like a straight face, though it should be noted he joined the Oval Office event via speakerphone, because the Trump administration cobbled this whole spectacle together at the last minute. (The British ambassador to the US even said that Trump called Starmer in a “very typical, 11th-hour intervention.”) The Brits, for their part, said even an imperfect deal is better than no deal at all. Asked by reporters in England whether this deal marks an improvement on the US-UK relationship of six months ago, before Trump took office, Starmer replied: “The question you should be asking is: Is it better than where we were yesterday?” Which is a gentle British way of saying: Look, we’re all doing our little dances in the Trump show to avoid tempting the wrath of the leader of the world’s biggest economy. Wall Street, similarly, isn’t letting perfection be the enemy of the good. Stocks rallied in the US as investors – hungry for any sign Trump is going to relent on the trade war – embraced the White House’s optimism. Just for kicks, let’s say this is an actual framework for a real trade deal that will get hammered out over the next few weeks. That is better than nothing. But it took more than a month to roll out this titanic nothingburger with one of our closest allies. An ally that, with all due affection to our British brethren, accounts for just 3% of all US trade, Justin Wolfers, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, told CNN. That doesn’t bode well for the thousands of American businesses that are currently paralyzed by Trump’s 145% tariffs on most imports from China, an adversary that’s not so charmed by the president’s 11th-hour shenanigans and is America’s third-largest trading partner. US and Chinese envoys are set to meet this weekend in Geneva. But American officials aren’t even suggesting a trade deal will come out of it – the best that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he’s hoping for is “de-escalation.” Bottom line: Very little has changed about the state of the global economy since the US-UK “deal” was announced. We still have a 22% effective tariff rate today – the highest in more than 100 years – compared with 2.5% before Trump took office. “Overwhelmingly the most important fact about today’s trade deal is that the 10% across the board tariffs are staying,” Wolfers said on social media Thursday. “Tiny tweaks here and there with some trading partners won’t change that. The US is a high tariff country for the foreseeable future, and the trade war continues.”",2025-05-10
CNN,Business,Brian Melley/AP,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/business/google-internet-giant-crackdown,"Just Google it. The phrase is a testament to just how synonymous the internet giant has become with finding information online as its services are now ubiquitous across everything from smartphones to laptops and even cars. But that success has come at a cost, according to the US government. Since 2023, two separate federal judges and a federal jury have ruled that Google has an illegal monopoly in its search engine, online advertising business and app store. Google is fighting to overturn those decisions, which could force the nearly $2 trillion company to split up — if that happens, it would mark the biggest breakup of a tech company since AT&T. And it’s not just Google; Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have also faced antitrust scrutiny over how they operate their tech platforms. A breakup could especially hurt Google now, as AI surges and chatbots threaten to challenge its core business. Friday marks the end of a three-week series of hearings that could determine the future of one of the most important tech companies in history, potentially reshaping the way billions of people use the internet. A decision is expected in August. So how did Google get so big? The answer might be sitting in your hand. Today, Google is much more than a search engine. A series of acquisitions and product launches from the early 2000s put it at the helm of the most popular corners of the internet, from YouTube — which has become teens’ most used social media platform — to the world’s most popular web browser and most widely used smartphone software. “The friction to switch from Google to something else, it wasn’t worth it,” said Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Why would you? You’re not getting better results.” Google’s search engine took off in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it had a novel way of ranking results: by importance, based on how often other sites linked to them, shedding light on which websites had more credibility and relevance. Rivals like Yahoo and Ask Jeeves indexed web results more like “a file folder” organizing results by topic, according to David Brumley, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Google inked contracts worth tens of billions of dollars to make it the default search provider on iPhones, while also striking deals to preload its search engine and browser on Android phones. Those arrangements, the Justice Department and a group of states argued, along with Google’s Chrome browser being so closely tied to its search engine, stifled competition in the search market. Last year, US District Judge Amit Mehta deemed those deals anticompetitive, calling Google a “monopolist” in online search. The DOJ now wants Google to either spin off or make major changes to its Chrome browser and Android operating system. Google has said it plans to appeal the case and last month called it “backwards looking” at “a time of intense competition and unprecedented innovation.” In the courtroom, Google argued that the DOJ’s proposal would pose security risks, hamper Google’s ability to invest in research and development, and harm Chrome as well as other businesses that rely on Google Search. It is instead proposing amending its browser agreements to allow companies to switch their default browser provider every 12 months, among other changes. Asked for comment on this story, a Google spokesperson pointed CNN to its public statements regarding the antitrust cases. As Google’s search engine grew in popularity, so did its lucrative advertising business, which brought in $66.9 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2025. “Google was able to basically sell a lot of ads because they were able to deliver the most eyeballs, and they were able to deliver a lot of, the most, eyeballs because they sold a lot of ads,” said Siegel. Google also developed a technology “stack” that enabled brands to buy online ads and publishers to sell online ad space all through one company. In April, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that Google was able to “establish and protect its monopoly power” by tying its ad server and publisher exchange together. However, she sided with Google by ruling against one of the government’s claims related to the search giant’s online advertiser ad networks. Related article
Google is an online advertising monopoly, judge rules Google is also appealing that case, which could force it to divest part of its online advertising business or, more likely, restrict how it can operate or price its services. The DOJ is pushing for Google to sell two parts of its ad businesses to restore competition, according to a May 5 court filing. Historically, US regulators have left large companies alone if they had complementary, but not overlapping, offerings, only going after “vertical” mergers where companies bought up competitors, according to Abiel Garcia, a partner with law firm Kesselman, Brantly Stockinger LLP. But US regulators have begun to view companies with complementary services as also being problematic, said Garcia, who formerly served as deputy attorney general for the California Justice Department. The legal stakes are especially high for Google amid predictions that AI tools will take over some of the functions of search engines. Market research firm Gartner estimated last year that traditional search engine volume would drop 25% by 2026 as consumers gravitate towards AI tools. An Apple executive said in his courtroom testimony during this week’s hearings that Google search queries on Apple devices have decreased, according to Bloomberg. (Google said in a statement on Wednesday that it “continues to see overall query growth in search.”) And OpenAI’s ChatGPT poses stiff competition; Google’s Gemini is roughly 10% of ChatGPT’s size on most user growth metrics, analysts at Barclays wrote in a research note from April 24. “The question is, will AI solutions give us better products?” Siegel said. “And that might cause people to switch and move away over time.”",2025-05-10
CNN,Politics,Joe Raedle/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/trump-tax-wealthy-house-republicans,"President Donald Trump said he’s open to hiking taxes on wealthy Americans to help pay for Republicans’ sweeping tax and spending cuts package, but the idea remains hotly contested among GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In a Truth Social post Friday morning, Trump said that he would “graciously accept” even a “TINY” tax increase on the rich, while acknowledging that that it could bring political risks for Republicans. House GOP lawmakers have been struggling to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to help offset trillions of dollars of tax reductions. “The problem with even a ‘TINY’ tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,’ the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!” Trump wrote. “In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!” he continued. Trump also mentioned the possibility of letting tax cuts expire on top earners – targeting individuals who earn at least $2.5 million or couples that make at least $5 million — in a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a Republican source familiar with the matter told CNN’s Dana Bash. The White House has made the suggestion to Congress with the thought that not only would it help achieve much needed offsets, it could also help wipe away Democrats’ argument about tax cuts for the rich, the source familiar said. This is not the first time Trump has indicated that he supports raising taxes on the wealthy, even though throughout last year’s presidential campaign, he repeatedly promised to cut their taxes. The president recently told Time magazine, “I actually love the concept,” when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $1 million a year. The idea, however, is not being warmly embraced among the House GOP and is far from guaranteed to make it into the president’s final “one big beautiful” bill, which aims to make permanent the sweeping Trump 2017 tax cuts and incorporate the president’s campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and certain other income. Just extending the 2017 individual tax provisions – which expire at the end of this year – could cost more than $4 trillion. Republican lawmakers are also fractured on how deeply they’d have to cut spending – including on Medicaid and food stamps – to meet their targets. Within the House Ways and Means Committee, members have discussed two ideas. One is to let the tax breaks for the richest Americans expire, returning their top income tax rate to 39.6% – which is what it was before Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul – from the current 37%. This has drawn some criticism, however, as some Republicans fear it could impact small business owners. But it could hit roughly 1.5 million households and cut about $409 billion of the cost, as well as greatly limit potential economic growth from making the tax cuts permanent, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. Another idea is to create a brand-new tax bracket for the wealthy. The proposal, though limited in scope, could contribute to offsetting costly tax provisions, such as restoring the state and local tax deduction – known as SALT – that has become another flashpoint in Congress’ tax debate. The new tax bracket would raise about $59.3 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. And it would affect between 150,000 and 200,000 households and would have a much smaller dampening effect on the package’s economic growth potential. Levying a higher income tax rate on the very wealthiest of Americans would raise less money because much of that group’s earnings come from dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates, said Garrett Watson, the foundation’s director of policy analysis. Also, there are much fewer of them. One of the considerations for Republicans is what the goal of such a provision would be – to limit how much of the benefit is going to the rich or to raise more money to offset other tax cuts, Watson said. Despite Trump’s apparent openness to raising taxes on the wealthy, his economic adviser said Friday that the president “is not a strong advocate” of the idea. Asked whether Trump is seriously considering taxing the rich to pay for his budget bill, National Economic Director Kevin Hassett said: “The president is not a strong advocate of that, but he is a strong advocate of many things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and nice treatment for auto loans.” “He has cited his priorities, and he understands that in the end, the final bill will include some priorities of members of the House of the Senate. That’s how the democratic process works, and that’s really what this conversation is about.” Trump reaffirmed Friday evening, however, that he’s open to taxing rich Americans, calling it “good politics.” A reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office what his message would be to conservative Republicans who warn it’s a tax increase on small business owners. Trump cast it as a “redistribution.” “People would love to do it — rich people. I would love to do it, frankly,” the president said. When asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill, given a number of its stated priorities are expensive, Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts, without detailing what they are and whether they are achievable. “Well, the budget rules in the House and the Senate are very clearly identified that include spending cuts and so on, and they don’t include dynamic scores,” he told CNN. “And so in the fullest of time with the spending cuts that we’re achieving ,and the dynamic score of the tax bill, we’re highly confident that we’re going to reduce the deficit that make bond markets celebrate.” Hassett has been meeting almost weekly with Johnson, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others regarding Congress’ budget. Earlier this week, the group met in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. This story has been updated with additional details.

CNN,Politics,"Congress needs to address debt ceiling before its August recess to prevent default, Treasury secretary says",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/treasury-debt-ceiling-x-date,"Lawmakers have until August to address the debt ceiling or the US could default on its obligations for the first time ever, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote to congressional leaders Friday, urging them to act even sooner, “to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.” The projection gives Republican lawmakers – who control Capitol Hill – a firmer deadline of when they have to pass their massive budget reconciliation bill, which aims to increase the debt ceiling along with extending the 2017 tax cuts and slashing federal spending. In his letter, Bessent said there is a “reasonable probability” that the cash and extraordinary measures that are allowing Treasury to continue paying the nation’s bills in full and on time will be exhausted in August, pointing out that is when Congress is scheduled to be in recess. But he noted that the projection is subject to “significant uncertainty.” “Therefore, I respectfully urge Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July, before its scheduled break, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” he wrote. Treasury has been using cash and extraordinary measures to pay the nation’s bills in full and on time since January 21, when the US hit its roughly $36 trillion debt ceiling. Once the nation reaches that cap, which it has done repeatedly, it can no longer borrow to cover its obligations in full and on time. A default would likely cause global economic upheaval. House GOP leaders are closely monitoring projections for the so-called X-date, when the government could default, House Speaker Mike Johnson said at an Axios event in late April. “That’s a big pressure point, and we don’t know exactly when that X date will fall,” Johnson said, noting at the time that he was working under the assumption it could be as early as the beginning of June. “We can’t be caught flat-footed on this.” However, the caucus remains divided over how to address all three of its goals in the “big, beautiful bill,” leaving leaders with the tricky task of constructing a package that can get enough GOP votes to pass both chambers. In March, Bessent told lawmakers that he would continue using extraordinary measures – which are largely behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers – through June 27. The Congressional Budget Office in March projected that the “X-date” would be reached in August or September. Though they control Congress, Republicans are divided over how to handle the debt ceiling. The House has included a $4 trillion increase to the cap in its budget resolution, while the Senate version raises the limit by $5 trillion. President Donald Trump has pushed GOP lawmakers to address the limit as soon as possible.",2025-05-10
CNN,Politics,"Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a Bush nominee who veered to the left, dies at 85",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/souter-supreme-court-dies,"Former Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a Republican appointee who retired from the high court in 2009 after voting consistently with its liberal wing, has died, the Supreme Court announced on Friday. He was 85 years old. Souter, a low-key New Englander who eschewed the national spotlight, was known by some as the “stealth nominee” when President George H.W. Bush nominated him in 1990 to replace the liberal lion William Brennan. Advisers assured the president that Souter would move the court to the right – a misreading that continues to reverberate today. The Supreme Court said Souter died “peacefully” on Thursday at his home in New Hampshire, but did not disclose the cause. “Justice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly twenty years,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. “He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service.” Measured, scholarly and faithful to the idea of judicial restraint, those who knew Souter said his approach to the law shouldn’t have surprised anyone who was paying close attention. “The whole point of it was that it was a Constitution and a Bill of Rights for the indefinite future,” Souter said during a 2012 event. “The application of these values, the problem of trying to make them work in practice, was an assignment that was left to the future.” It did not take conservatives long to regret Souter’s nomination. After less than two years on the bench, he helped orchestrate a significant opinion that upheld the central tenet of Roe v. Wade, that the right to abortion was implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution. It wasn’t until 2022 – three decades later – that the court ultimately overturned Roe. And he would go on to side with the court’s liberal bloc in cases dealing with civil rights, affirmative action and voting. His tenure inspired a rallying cry on the right – “No More Souters” – and led to a more rigorous ideological vetting of candidates. Subsequent nominees from both parties – including today’s justices – are less likely to break with the party that appointed them. Justice Clarence Thomas, who joined the court about a year after Souter, remembered him as a “wonderful colleague” who was “kind, honorable, and decent,” in a statement released by the Supreme Court on Friday. Justice Samuel Alito, who also overlapped with Souter, said he was impressed with his “learning, his dedication to the law, and his delightfully old-fashioned ways.” “I was very sorry to see him retire, but he sorely missed his native New Hampshire and his book-laden home there, and I was happy that he was able to spend the last 16 years of his life in the surroundings he cherished living the kind of private life he preferred,” Alito said a statement released by the court. “David Souter was a unique man with a special kindness and grace. He joined the court purely out of a sense of duty to the country,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who replaced Souter on the bench after he retired in 2009. Attorney General Pam Bondi described Souter in a social media post Friday as a “brilliant man who devoted his life to public service and our courts.” Souter wrote a widely cited First Amendment unanimous opinion in 1995 that permitted organizers of a St. Patrick’s Day parade in Boston to deny a place for an LGBTQ group. A decade later, he wrote for a 5-4 majority finding that three counties in Kentucky had violated the Frist Amendment when they displayed framed copies of the Ten Commandments in courthouses and public schools. “The divisiveness of religion in current public life is inescapable,” Souter wrote. “This is no time to deny the prudence of understanding the establishment clause to require the government to stay neutral on religious belief, which is reserved for the conscience of the individual.” He was often understated in his opinions. In a 2009 concurrence in a case involving Navajo Nation mineral rights, Souter put down only two sentences. “I am not through regretting that my position” in an early case “did not carry the day,” he wrote. “But it did not, and I agree that the precedent of that case calls for the result reached here.” In another break with today’s norms, Souter stepped down after 19 years on the Supreme Court, seeking a return to his contemplative life in New Hampshire. Never married and never fond of the Washington social scene, Souter was only 69 when he stepped down – far younger than most departing justices. His retirement gave President Barack Obama, a Democrat, his first chance to name a Supreme Court justice. Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, a self-described “fiery Latina” to fill the shoes of the low-key New England native Souter. Today, Sotomayor is the senior member of the court’s three-justice liberal bloc. Souter, happy to leave the politics and agitation of Washington behind, spent his retirement in New Hampshire, often sitting on lower courts to fill a vacancy when necessary. His preference for a quieter life was evident during his time at the Supreme Court where he spurned technology and wrote his opinions in longhand. Asked if there would ever be cameras in the courtroom, he famously said, “over my dead body.” A stinging defeat for Souter was the 2000 decision Bush v. Gore that cleared the way for Bush’s presidency. “He was very aggrieved” by the decision, said Ralph Neas, the founder for People for the American Way. “He believed it was the ultimate politicization of the Supreme Court.” David Hackett Souter was born in Massachusetts in 1939 but he grew up and attended grade school in New Hampshire. His father was a banker and his mother was a store clerk. He spent the summers as a child in his grandparents’ house in New Hampshire, and attended Harvard, Oxford and Harvard Law School. In 1976, Souter became New Hampshire’s attorney general, taking over for Warren Rudman. Rudman, a centrist Republican, would go on to serve in the US Senate and become one of Souter’s greatest champions. Despite stiff opposition from the NAACP and the National Organization for Women, Souter was confirmed 90-9 by the Senate. Douglas Kmiec, a lawyer who served in the Bush administration, said that Souter “was tabula rasa” when he showed up on the bench and called him a “surprise.” “The law for him, unlike many of his conservative colleagues, was not an abstract set of rules totally divorced from its effect in the real world,” said Peter Rubin a former law clerk. “It wasn’t just an intellectual puzzle for him.” Some of his habits were idiosyncratic, especially for Washington.  Souter was known to be a charming guest, but he didn’t go out much. Instead, he preferred solo pursuits like reading and hiking in the New Hampshire mountains. In 2016, at a joint appearance discussing the role of food at the Supreme Court, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sotomayor revealed his unusual lunch habit. “My dear colleague David Souter,” Ginsburg said, with a hint of distaste, ate one thing for lunch most days: plain yogurt. “I understood,” Sotomayor said, “he had an apple.” Yes, Ginsburg replied. Sotomayor added: “He ate the core.” After retiring from the Supreme Court, Souter continued to occasionally hear cases on the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals. He also took part in civics education curriculum reform efforts in New Hampshire, the court said. “His depth of commitment to the rule of law, his reverence for the Constitution, his faith in the American legal tradition, and his deep respect for the profession of law had a profound influence on all of us who had the privilege of sitting with him,” said 1st Circuit Chief Judge David Barron. In 2010, Souter set out his philosophy during a commencement speech at Harvard. “We want not only liberty, but equality as well,” he said. “These paired desires of ours can clash, and when they do, a court is forced to choose between them, between one constitutional good and another one,” he said. “The court has to decide which of our approved desires has the better claim, right here, right now, and a court has to do more than read fairly when it makes this kind of choice.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

CNN,Politics,"US warns that if Sunday Iran talks aren’t productive, ‘they won’t continue’",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/witkoff-iran-talks-warning,"US special envoy Steve Witkoff warned that if Sunday’s talks with Iran are not productive, “then they won’t continue and we’ll have to take a different route.” In an interview with Breitbart posted Friday, Witkoff said the US opted against holding another round of talks last week “because we needed to get to certain understandings with” Iran in order for discussions to be useful. “Hopefully this Sunday they will be productive. Hopefully that means they will continue those talks,” he said. The talks in Oman on Sunday will only be high-level, suggesting that the two sides would discuss a broader framework for moving forward. A source familiar told CNN that the technical team, which negotiates on more granular aspects of a deal like sanctions relief, is not expected to attend. “It was appropriate to have the next round of talks at the principals level,” the source said. Another source familiar said the discussions are expected to be both direct and indirect. In the interview with Breitbart, Witkoff described the US expectations for the talks in some of the greatest detail to date. “An enrichment program can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. That’s our red line. No enrichment. That means dismantlement, it means no weaponization, and it means that Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan—those are their three enrichment facilities—have to be dismantled,” he said. Iran has said it must be allowed to enrich uranium, that it’s non-negotiable. “Iran has every right to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is expected to meet Witkoff on Sunday, wrote on X a week ago. Similar to the negotiations with Russia, where the US has floated incentives to end the war in Ukraine, Witkoff hinted at similar incentives with Tehran. “We’re inviting Iran to be a member of the league of nations,” he said. “We’re saying to Iran: ‘You can be a better nation. We can do business with you. We can have strategic relationships with you. But you can’t be a provocateur.’” Witkoff said Iran has told the US it does not want a nuclear weapon – a position Tehran has long maintained. The special envoy said that the talks are focused exclusively on the nuclear issue, a change from the attempts of the first Trump administration to deal widely with Iran’s aggressive actions in the region. “Do we think they need to stop enabling Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and pulling back from being a provocateur? We do believe that. That’s a secondary discussion,” he said. “Do we think that they should not be supplying weapons to people we consider to be our enemies? We believe that. But again, we don’t want to confuse the nuclear discussion because that to us is the existential issue. That’s the issue that needs to be solved today and quickly.” CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this story.",2025-05-10
CNN,Politics,Pentagon orders military academies to review books for possible removal,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/pentagon-military-academies-review-books,"The Pentagon has ordered all military academies to identify and remove books from their libraries that deal with issues such as race, gender ideology, and other “divisive concepts” that are now considered “incompatible with the department’s core mission,” according to a memo obtained by CNN. The memo, dated Friday, is signed by the acting deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness and also announces the creation of a temporary Academic Libraries Committee “comprised of knowledgeable leaders, educators, and library professionals” from across the Defense Department who will help identify and “sequester” the offending books for further review. The books must be identified and set aside for review by May 21, the memo says. The committee has already developed a list of search terms to help military leaders identify books that may need to be removed. The terms include: “Affirmative action,” “anti-racism,” “allyship,” “diversity in the workplace,” “gender transition,” “white privilege,” and “critical race theory,” according to an attachment to the memo. The establishment of a special committee to review books for removal across the military academies marks an escalation of the Defense Department’s efforts to eliminate “diversity, equity, and inclusion” content across the military. In a separate memo released on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also said there will be “no consideration of race, ethnicity, or sex” in admissions to US military academies, which will focus admissions “exclusively on merit.” The memo ordered the service academies to rank candidates, starting with the 2026 admissions cycle, “by merit-based scores,” accepting the highest-ranking candidates in each nomination category. “Merit-based scores may give weight to unique athletic talent or other experiences such as prior military service or performance at a MSA preparatory school,” the memo says. It’s unclear how the directive will impact the ability of US senators to recommend people for admission to the military academies. The Naval Academy has already removed nearly 400 books from its main library in an attempt to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order in January mandating the removal of all “diversity, equity, and inclusion” content from K-12 schools, which Hegseth later said also applied to military academies. The Naval Academy also canceled a lecture that author Ryan Holiday was scheduled to give to students there last month after he refused to remove slides from his planned presentation that criticized the academy’s decision to remove the books, CNN reported. A tenured professor of philosophy at West Point wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times on Thursday that he was resigning after 13 years at the school because it was “suddenly eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments to comport with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration.” The professor, Graham Parsons, wrote that West Point was interpreting Hegseth’s order “broadly,” and conducting “a sweeping assault on the school’s curriculum and the faculty members’ research.” In response to Parson’s op-ed, Hegseth posted on X on Thursday, “You will not be missed Professor Parsons,” and the DoD’s rapid response account called Parsons “woke.” Students and parents also told CNN last month that the anti-DEI policy is having a direct impact on students at Defense Department schools around the globe, as classes like AP Psychology and certain student clubs and books have been banned from DoD schools. The ACLU has sued DoD over the policy. Meanwhile, articles about the Holocaust, the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, cancer awareness, sexual assault and suicide prevention were among the tens of thousands either removed or flagged for removal from Pentagon websites as the department scrambled to comply with Hegseth’s order. The Friday memo standing up the libraries committee said the review of the book removals would be “deliberate” and conducted by “experts in the fields of education and the department’s mission.”",2025-05-10
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Rob Kim/Getty Images North America/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-trial-cassie-ventura,"Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs and one of his accusers, could take the stand as early as Monday as one of the first three witnesses called in the government’s sex-trafficking case against the music mogul. Prosecutors indicated in court on Friday that they would call two “quick” witnesses before calling “Victim 1,” whose testimony will take up most of the first week. Ventura, who is pregnant with her third child and due to deliver next month, is referred to as “Victim 1” in the indictment but has agreed to testify in her own name. Prosecutors allege Combs coerced her into having sex with male prostitutes, according to the indictment. Combs’ attorneys have said all sex was consensual. Combs’ defense team said in court they plan to argue that Ventura had a propensity for violence toward Combs during their relationship, which lasted approximately 11 years, from 2007 to 2018. “We are going to take the position that there was mutual violence in their relationship,” defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in court Friday. “That there was hitting on both sides,” Agnifilo added. “We’re probably going to refer to it as domestic violence.” The defense attorneys said they may want to ask Ventura about violent interactions they say she’s had unrelated to the allegations in this case, which they allege will discredit the claim Combs coerced her into sexual activity. The judge said he would rule on that Monday. Combs nodded when his lawyer Alexandra Shapiro said, “The dynamic between these two individuals is at the very heart of this case.” Ventura’s attorney, Douglas Wilder, declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all charges, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Among the topics likely to be raised in Ventura’s testimony is hotel surveillance footage from 2016 that shows Combs grabbing, kicking and dragging her. Despite attempts by his attorneys to exclude the footage from evidence, Judge Arun Subramanian issued a ruling last month that it could be shown to the jury at trial. After CNN first published video of the incident last May, Combs posted an apology on his Instagram account, saying, “My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.” Jury selection was initially set to be finalized on Friday, but Judge Subramanian expressed concern that some prospective jurors could get cold feet before the start of opening statements on Monday. The judge struck two jurors from the prospective pool of 45, reducing the overall pool to 43. One woman who was qualified earlier in the week contacted the court expressing issues of personal well-being, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in court. A man was struck from the pool because he didn’t disclose an open lawsuit he’s pursuing against the city of New York during questioning. “We may be in a situation where on Monday we’re starting out already down some alternate jurors,” the judge said. Assistant US attorney Maurene Comey said the government “strongly oppose” any delays. “If one raises his or her hand and says I have an issue we could have an avalanche effect,” she said. “We are also working against a clock on our end which we’re very cognizant of next week.” Judge Subramanian said the pool of 43 will be called to arrive by 8:30am Monday morning, so they can start opening statements at 9:30 as originally planned. The trial is anticipated to last eight weeks. CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.",2025-05-10
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/entertainment/ellen-degeneres-new-look-farm,"Ellen DeGeneres looks to be enjoying life in the English countryside. The former daytime talk-show host recently shared with her social media followers how different both she and her view look these days. In a video posted on her verified Instagram account, a now brunette DeGeneres is seen riding a lawnmower on her British estate. The comedian shared the video in the form of the popular “How it started…how it’s going” trend. The footage start with her riding the mower and ends with her needing to be pushed when the machine breaks down. “Portia thought it would be fun to film my first time on the mower,” the caption reads. “She was right.” The actress Portia de Rossi has been married to DeGeneres since 2008. DeGeneres and de Rossi reportedly moved to the United Kingdom in November 2024. The move came more than two years after “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” finished its run in 2022. The show wrapped two years after a controversy involving former staff members, who alleged they faced intimidation and racism while working on the popular daytime show. DeGeneres issued an apology to her staff in July 2020. “On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ would be a place of happiness – no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect,” DeGeneres said then. “Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it’s the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.” She joked about the situation in her Netflix comedy special, “Ellen’s Last Stand…Up.” “Let me catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you last saw me,” she said. “I got chickens. Oh yeah, and I got kicked out of show business for being mean.”",2025-05-10
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/entertainment/blake-lively-testify-justin-baldoni-trial,"In the latest development in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, Lively’s lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb have confirmed that the actress intends to take the stand when the case heads to trial next year. “This is a case about what happened to Blake Lively when she raised claims of sexual harassment on set and the retaliation that followed. Of course she will testify,” Hudson and Gottlieb said in a statement to CNN on Thursday. Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and retaliation in a complaint first filed with the California Civil Rights Department in December, preceding a lawsuit that followed about a week later. She also claimed that Baldoni, along with his PR representatives, orchestrated a “social manipulation campaign” to hurt her reputation in the media while they were promoting “It Ends with Us,” their 2024 film at the center of the dispute. First reported by People, Gottlieb said on Thursday that Lively plans to testify because “the ultimate moment for a plaintiff’s story to be told is at trial.” “We expect that to be the case here (with Lively),” he added. “So we would, of course, expect her to be a witness at her trial.” When reached for comment on Thursday, Baldoni’s lawyer Bryan Freedman said, “Although obviously uncomfortable for the Lively parties, the truth is not a distraction. The truth has been clearly shown through unedited receipts, documents and real life footage.” In an amended complaint filed in February, Lively alleged other women also raised claims about Baldoni’s behavior on set. Freedman previously denied the allegations in a statement to CNN, saying, “These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media.” Gottlieb stopped short of confirming whether Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds will testify at trial, saying that it’s his belief that Baldoni’s allegations against Reynolds are “frivolous.” Along with Lively, Reynolds is named as a defendant in the $400 million defamation lawsuit Baldoni filed in January. Baldoni has accused Reynolds of assisting Lively in “hijacking” his film and taking down his career. He claimed that Reynolds, who had no formal role on “It Ends With Us,” re-wrote a scene and made “unauthorized changes to the script in secret.” Baldoni also accused Reynolds of reprimanding him at the couple’s home in New York and alleged Reynolds made fun of him in “Deadpool & Wolverine,” mirroring the character Nicepool after Baldoni in an effort to mock him. In March, Gottlieb filed a request for Reynolds to be dropped as a defendant from Baldoni’s suit, claiming that his argument against Reynolds has no legal bounds and amounts to “hurt feelings.” If Reynolds is dropped as a defendant, then he “may or may not be a fact witness” at trial, Gottlieb added. There are other individuals who will be testifying at trial to support Lively’s claims, said Gottlieb, adding that these individuals “were witnesses to or experienced misconduct that is relevant to Ms. Lively’s claims” and that he expects these witnesses to testify about “what took place on set.” Baldoni also accused Lively in his defamation suit of working to “destroy” him professionally by collaborating with the New York Times on an article about the complaint she filed with the California Civil Rights Department in December. Baldoni, who directed and starred alongside Lively in “It Ends with Us,” also filed a libel suit against the New York Times in January, in which he claimed that the newspaper published an article “rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions.” A spokesperson for The New York Times told CNN at the time that the publication plans to “vigorously defend against the lawsuit.” Both Baldoni and Lively’s attorneys have previously said that they do not intend to settle. The trial is currently set for March 2026. CNN’s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.",2025-05-10
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/entertainment/barry-keoghan-beatles-ringo-starr-meeting,"Barry Keoghan finally got to meet Ringo Starr, who he is set to portray in the upcoming Beatles biopics, and the two “just sat in the garden chatting away” during the meeting. Keoghan appeared on Wednesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” and told the late night host that he only recently met the Beatles drummer for the first time at his home, and that Starr even played the drums for him. “He asked me to play but I wasn’t playing the drums for Ringo,” Keoghan said, adding that Starr’s private drum performance “just kind of naturally happened” and that “it was sort of one of those moments where you’re just in awe.” Keoghan admitted his nerves got the best of him and that at one point he told Starr he “couldn’t look at him.” Eventually, the “Saltburn” actor started to relax so that he could absorb what Starr is like in real life to help him craft his portrayal in the Sam Mendes-directed suite of biopics. “My job is to observe and take in all kinds of mannerisms and study him,” Keoghan said. “I want to humanize him and bring feelings to him and not just sort of imitate.” In November, Starr broke the news that Keoghan was cast to portray him during an interview with Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier, saying he thought it was “great” that Keoghan got the part and that he believed he was “somewhere taking drum lessons.” Mendes has been tapped to direct four separate biopics chronicling the story of The Beatles from each band member’s point of view, which will collectively “intersect to tell the astonishing story of the greatest band in history,” according to an announcement from Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE). SPE announced the full cast last month, confirming that “Babygirl” star Harris Dickinson will play John Lennon, Paul Mescal will portray Paul McCartney, and “Stranger Things” star Joseph Quinn will play George Harrison, in addition to Keoghan’s portrayal of Starr. The films are being billed by Sony executive Tom Rothman as “the first bingeable theatrical experience,” and are set to hit theaters in April 2028.",2025-05-10
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Loic Venance/AFP via Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/entertainment/michael-pitt-new-york,"Actor Michael Pitt, known for his TV roles on “Boardwalk Empire” and “Dawson’s Creek,” is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend, choking her, and attacking her with a cinder block and a piece of lumber at his New York City home, according to a grand jury indictment. Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts, including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt’s home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez’s office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment. Pitt’s lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed. “Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt — an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes — can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,” Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press. He added, “In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.” Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt’s case has not done. The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch (10-centimeter-by-10-centimeter) piece of lumber. The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021. Pitt, who grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, played the character Jimmy Darmody for two seasons on HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire,” with the cast led by Steve Buscemi winning Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2011 and 2012 for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The show also won a Golden Globe for best drama series in 2011. His first major role came in the 2001 film “Hedwig and the Angry Inch.” In 2005, he starred in “Last Days,” director Gus Van Sant’s film about a fictional rock star inspired by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He also played Henry Parker in one season of The WB’s “Dawson’s Creek” in 1999-2000.",2025-05-10
CNN,Sports,Jonathan Hawkins/CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/sport/austin-forkner-supercross-racing-profile-spt,"Motorcycle racing is dangerous, of that there is no doubt. But within the sport there is one category that sits (bruised) head and (fractured) shoulders above the others. Supercross is a spectacular form of dirt-bike racing played out in stadiums, with wild jumps, eye-widening speeds and battling competition. Few riders embody the sport and its elements more than Austin Forkner, the most successful rider in the 250SX class never to win a title. The Missouri native has come close, but painful on-track mishaps have always gotten in the way. With its speed, acrobatics and general entertainment factor, Forkner tells CNN Sports that no sport has the blend of ingredients that Supercross offers: “It’s got the technicality of golf, we’re playing with inches out there. “It’s got the brutalness or gnarliness of fighting, like UFC fighting … then it’s got the physicality of, like, a triathlete. You have to be in such good shape, you have to be ready to be injured and ready to go to war, basically.” Talking to CNN at Triumph Racing America’s headquarters in picturesque countryside south of Atlanta, Georgia, the 26-year-old begins to list the injuries he has sustained in the saddle, gesturing to different parts of his body. “I’ll just go through them. I’ve done this collarbone three times, this collarbone twice; I broke this wrist, I broke my hip, my hip socket, I guess. Let’s see – when I was young, I broke my ankle and the growth plate …” It’s completely understandable that Forkner would have to think about it because this list goes on and on … and on. Far more broken bones and smashed body parts, in fact, than there is space here to list: “I’ve torn my ACL, or torn everything in my knee, basically, my right knee twice, my left knee once. A post shared by CNN Sports (@cnnsport) “I’ve torn my labrum in my shoulder twice, tore it, then retore it again. I actually had four surgeries on this shoulder within, like, 18 months, from two collarbones and two labrums. I compression-fractured my back a few years ago … and I rode with it because I didn’t know that it was compression-fractured.” These are still just some of the injuries this extraordinary competitor has overcome in his career. It takes Forkner almost three minutes to relay all of them; he has even had part of his pancreas removed, along with his spleen. But the most serious setback was not directly related to racing at all. In fact, were it not for the fact that the rider was being examined after a bad crash, it might never have been discovered. “Last year, after the crash where I broke my back and my shoulder and I was knocked out for like five minutes, they were doing scans on my head and they found out that I had something called an AVM (arteriovenous malformation),” Forkner explains. “And I actually had to have brain surgery to have that taken out.” A post shared by Austin Forkner (@austinforkner) AVM is a tangle of blood vessels that typically forms during fetal development and leads to irregular connections between arteries and veins in the brain. While many people born with AVMs live normal lives without even noticing, such malformations can be dangerous, even fatal if left untreated. Forkner admits that it was a shock to find out brain surgery was needed. “Even though I’ve done everything – I’ve done knees, shoulders, collarbones, wrists, ankles, everything like that, back,” he tells CNN, “it’s kind of two things you don’t really think about having surgery on: that’s your heart and your brain.” The surgery itself, while relatively routine, was an intimidating prospect. “They cut me from here to here, basically,” Forkner explains, gesturing across his hairline. “(They) had to essentially kind of pull the front part of my brain out of my skull a little bit so they could get down to what they were trying to do.” The other troubling aspect of the surgery was the recovery, he says. “I honestly didn’t really know what that meant for my career, just because, like all the other injuries, you’ll be back in, whatever, ACL, six months, any broken bone, six to eight weeks, you know, they kind of can give you a time frame,” Forkner continues. “This was kind of, ‘We don’t know.’ So, it was pretty scary in that way, but not speaking anything about (my career), it was just scary. It was just scary to have my brain opened up, basically.” After the event, though, perhaps unsurprisingly given the rider’s track record of recovering from injuries, Forkner’s path back into the saddle was relatively smooth and swift. “If I could have (gone) to the gym two weeks after, I probably would have (gone) to the gym two weeks after,” he smiles. “I was basically limited because the doctor didn’t want me to get my heart rate up, get the blood really flowing through there. He was like, ‘We need to be chill, because part of it is that the AVM can cause seizures, strokes, and aneurysms.” Not long after his return to fitness, however, Forkner made a big decision, uprooting from California, where he’d spent most of his career, and leaving his Kawasaki team to move to Georgia and join the relative newcomers to dirt bike racing, Triumph. But the Richards, Missouri-born rider was actually quite happy to leave California behind. “It was a big change coming from California all the way out here. I like Georgia way better than California. “It has the Midwest kind of small towns, you know, we’re out here, this reminds me exactly of the Midwest where I grew up, ponds and green grass. I’m way more at home here than I was in California.” The move also meant adapting to a completely new bike: “I don’t think you can understand exactly how much work goes into setting the bike up. The best way that I can explain it to somebody is that the forks or the front suspension on my bike, if they move that 0.5 millimeter, I feel it. “Let’s say there’s 10 to 12 turns on the track; if the bike turns better or doesn’t in certain sections, that could be a 10th of a second per turn. Ten turns, that’s a second a lap. A second a lap is a lot.” Jeremy Coker, general manager of Triumph Racing America, gushes about Forkner’s talent, but acknowledges that his team was taking a risk of its own bringing him on board. “Austin Forkner has a one-of-a-kind talent. I think if you were to ask any rider, any competitor that he races with, they’re going to say that he’s probably the most talented and fastest rider there is,” he tells CNN. “I think all of the injuries that he sustained, especially his brain injury, was a big setback for him,” Coker continues. “I think at that point that not only were people scared to hire him in the fact that maybe he’s not going to be as fast as he once was. “But also, the scare factor of – is this dangerous? Is this a risk that we’re willing to take? If he crashes, can he sustain a worse injury? Could it … as far as you know, kill him? I don’t mean to say it like that, but it’s a big risk. It’s something that’s scary.” Undoubtedly the biggest change of all for Forkner, however, came when he and his wife – model and influencer Rylee Forkner – celebrated the arrival of their son, Atlas Hope, in March of this year. The rider admits that fatherhood has already changed him. “I love my little boy more than anything else. It’s funny because everybody says it, it changes … your riding and stuff like that, and it changed it as far as I realized that yes, dirt bikes are my job, they’re my living,” Forkner says, “but for so long dirt bikes have been the only thing. They’ve been the most important thing. They’ve been all I think about when I wake up and all I think about when I go to bed, and now they’re not. A post shared by RYLEE FORKNER (@ryleeforkner) “Now (racing is) important because it’s my job, but whether I have a good day at the track or a bad day at the track and I go home and I can hold my little boy, it doesn’t matter – it makes it not matter. “It takes the added pressure that I put on myself off because I’m just like, ‘Hey, whether I win, whether I get last, I get to go home and hold my boy and everything’s gonna be OK.’” He also concedes that his new responsibilities are on his mind at the track: “That is something that has been a little bit of a battle this year, fighting the, ‘I need to go home. I need to be safe for my wife and my kid.’ “But then at the same time, you can’t ride with that lingering over you. Because you won’t ride loose and ride natural when you have something like that, telling yourself, ‘Be careful, you can’t ride like that’ – so it’s a process.” Perhaps though, the most revealing thing about being a father was the new insight into his relationship with his own parents. “Honestly, one of the biggest things about having a kid now is that it puts into perspective a lot my parents and what they’ve had to deal with, with me, just as far as how upset it makes you,” Forkner says. “If you’ve ever seen my mom at a race, she’s a disaster to watch a race with, she’s freaking out, grabbing somebody, but I understand that now, I understand that side of things, like how upset it must make her to see me go through – to see me just get beat down over and over again. I understand what that could do to you as a mother.” Would he encourage his son Atlas Hope to follow in his footsteps? “I’m gonna be hard pressed to tell him no,” Forkner smiles, “as far as if I’m gonna advise him to become a professional dirt bike rider. I don’t know if I would, I’m probably gonna advise against it. “In certain ways I can get a little bit bitter about the sport. Well yes, it’s given me a great life and I met all my friends, my wife, everybody that I know I’ve met through dirt bikes basically, but I’ve also seen a lot of the dark side of the sport. “But a lot of that has come from professional dirt bike racing where we are pushing the limits every single day, and that’s hard and that’s stressful, so am I gonna tell him he can’t ever touch a dirt bike? No. But I would prefer if we just do it for fun.”",2025-05-10

Steph Curry out for at least a week after injury in Game 1 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves The Warriors reduced the deficit to seven in the third quarter on a Jonathan Kuminga three, Minnesota’s smallest lead since the opening minute of the game, but then went on a four-and-a-half-minute scoreless run that ended any hopes of a win. “We made a really spirited run, got it to seven, and then we just kind of lost a little bit of composure,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, per Reuters. “We turned it over right out of that timeout a couple of times and gave up a couple threes where we lost connection defensively. But we learned a lot, and I think this game will help us figure out how to move forward.” Julius Randle powered the Timberwolves to victory with a game-high 24 points to go with seven rebounds and 11 assists. Star guard Anthony Edwards – who had to be helped to the locker room with an ankle injury in the second quarter, but later returned – and Nickeil Alexander-Walker both added 20 points “We watched film yesterday,” Edwards said, per Reuters. “We saw that it wasn’t just that we didn’t make shots (in Game 1), it was more so our defensive pressure and intensity. “We didn’t bring it. So, we knew we had to bring it today.” Kuminga had a team-high 18 points for the Warriors off the bench, while Jimmy Butler added 17 points. Trayce Jackson-Davis had 15 off the bench as Kerr used a 14-man rotation in an attempt to find a solution to Curry’s absence. The Warriors said Curry has a strained left hamstring and will be reevaluated in a week, meaning he could possibly return for Game 5, which is scheduled for May 14. “Part of the game plan coming in was to play a lot of people and we did,” Golden State coach Kerr said, per the NBA. “We have to figure out what we’re going to be able to do in this series without Steph. We gave a lot of people a lot of chances and some guys really stepped up. “We’ve got to figure out rotations and who we start, but they’re going to be a part of it. We’ve got to find some better ways to score.” The series moves to San Francisco for Game 3 on Saturday.",2025-05-10
CNN,Sports,Loic Cousin/Icon Sport/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/sport/josaia-raisuqe-death-fiji-rugby-castres-spt-intl,"Josaia Raisuqe, who won the men’s rugby sevens silver medal with Fiji at the Paris 2024 Olympics, has died, his club Castres Olympique said in a statement Thursday. He was 30 years old. Castres, a rugby union club which plays in France’s prestigious Top 14 championship, said Raisuqe died in a “road accident” and that the team learned of the death Thursday morning. CNN has reached out to local French police and Fiji Rugby for comment. In a statement, Castres said the club “is in mourning” and postponed its game against ASM Clermont that was scheduled for Saturday. “The entire CO (Castres Olympique) family is shaken by this terrible news,” the statement read. “Josh had been part of the club since 2021. He was a wonderful teammate, very much appreciated by all, and by the Castres supporters who had adopted him. We extend our sincere condolences and our thoughts to his family and loved ones.” The French National Rugby League said in a statement that tributes will be held for Raisuqe at all Top 14 and Pro D2 grounds this weekend. Raisuqe played in the rugby sevens gold medal match in Paris, which Fiji lost 28-7 to host France. Castres president Pierre-Yves Revol called Raisuqe, who was in the starting lineup for the team’s last game against Toulouse, “a radiant young man both on and off the field” and described him as “a pillar of the Fijian community that we have in the club and to which we are very attached.” “Of course, my thoughts are with his fiancée and all his family and I thank everyone who has reached out to the club,” Revol added.",2025-05-10

Steph Curry out for at least a week after injury in Game 1 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves Teams that win the first two games of a playoff series on the road advance to the next round 85.7% of the time, per the Associated Press. The defending champions are now in real danger of being eliminated with the next two games at a raucous Madison Square Garden. “Two games we’re up 20 points (and) somehow end up not with wins is inexcusable,” Boston star Jaylen Brown, who was the victim of Bridges’ game-winning steal in the series opener, told reporters. “Obviously, being down two, it sucks. “It’s an opportunity to show what we’re made of,” Brown added. “Obviously, we wouldn’t like to be in this position, but we’re here now, so we got to respond.” No team in the history of the NBA has shot more three-pointers than this version of the Celtics, but it has been their undoing so far in this series, going a combined 25-of-100 from deep across Games 1 and 2 – including missing a league playoff-record 45 triples in the opener. The Celtics offense crumbled in the fourth quarter, missing 14 of its final 15 shots that included an incredible run of more than eight minutes without a bucket. It has been a remarkable start to the series for a Knicks team that finished 10 games back from the No. 1 seed Celtics and got swept 4-0 in the teams’ regular season matchups. Josh Hart finished with a game-high 23 points for the Knicks, while Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 17 rebounds. Brunson, the 2024-25 Clutch Player of the Year, had 17 points – including the Knicks’ last six of the game – and seven assists. After shooting 0-for-8 through the first three quarters, Bridges scored all 14 of his points in the fourth before his crucial steal at the end. Bridges said after the game that the team is “just finding ways to win.” For the Celtics, Derrick White and Brown had 20 points, but it was a tough night for Tatum who finished with 13 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Game 3 is at Madison Square Garden in New York on Saturday. The Oklahoma City Thunder demolished the Denver Nuggets 149-106 on Wednesday to level the series at 1-1. Oklahoma set a new NBA playoff record for points scored in a half, dropping a staggering 87 in the first half against the Nuggets. Denver, who fired longtime head coach Michael Malone just before the playoffs, snatched a win in Game 1 with a late Aaron Gordon three-pointer, but Game 2 was never even a contest as the Thunder raced out to a 24-point, first-quarter lead. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a game-high 34 points for the Thunder to go with eight assists and four rebounds, while Chet Holmgren posted a double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds. All five Thunder starters, plus three players off the bench, hit double figures in the rout. Nikola Jokić, Gilgeous-Alexander’s rival for the MVP award, scored just 17 points and fouled out in the third quarter. The three-time MVP had a historic 42-point, 22-rebound performance in Game 1.

CNN,Sports,Emilee Chinn/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/sport/rory-mcilroy-return-major-masters-us-pga-spt-intl,"Rory McIlroy says he feels “a lot less pressure” as he prepares to return to major action having ended years of heartbreak with his victory at the Masters last month. The Northern Irishman was finally able to slip on the famous green jacket and enter himself into the record books – becoming the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam of winning each of golf’s four majors – after prevailing at Augusta National, sparking emotional scenes of celebrations. With that monkey off his back, McIlroy returns to major action at next week’s PGA Championship at Quail Hollow. And by ending an 11-year wait for his fifth major title, the 35-year-old admitted that he’s going to arrive in Charlotte, North Carolina, with far fewer expectations on his shoulders. “I’m obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure, and I’m also going back to a venue that I love. It’s nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened a few weeks ago and then with my history there and how well I’ve played at Quail,” McIlroy told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the Truist Championship in Philadelphia. “It probably will feel a little bit different. I probably won’t be quite as on edge as I have been for the last few years when I’ve been at major championships. I’ll probably be a little bit better to be around for my family, and I’ll be a little more relaxed. I think overall it will be a good thing.” Related article
Rory McIlroy could go onto win 10 majors now Masters ‘shackles are off,’ says men’s captain of his hometown golf club There’s a reason for McIlroy to be so confident heading into the second major of 2025. He won the Truist Championship by five shots last year at Quail Hollow when it was staged there and already has gotten off to an excellent start on the PGA Tour this season with two other victories outside of his Masters triumph. This year, the tournament is being held on the Wissahickon Course at the Philadelphia Cricket Club as McIlroy seeks to defend his crown and claim his fifth Truist Championship title in the process. McIlroy said that he’s cherished his time celebrating his Masters victory with friends and family, describing him and his mom being a “mess for a few minutes” when they first saw each other afterwards. “Look, as an only child, I have a bond,” McIlroy said. “I’m lucky, and I know a lot of people feel this, that they have a close bond with their parents, but I think as time goes on and I’m getting a little older, I realize that they’re not going to be around forever. It means even more that they were still around to be able to see me complete the slam and fulfill those dreams.” But he admitted he’s also enjoyed returning to the day job having stepped back into competitive action at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last week. “Good to be here. First week, I guess, as an individual coming back and playing over the last few weeks. I’m excited to get back to being a golfer,” the world No. 2 said.",2025-05-10
