CNN,Business,Trump tells Walmart to ‘eat the tariffs’ as retailer expects prices to increase,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/business/walmart-product-prices-tariffs,"President Donald Trump on Saturday said Walmart needs to stop “trying to blame tariffs” after the retail giant announced its products would become more expensive. Walmart’s CEO said the price increases were a result of Trump’s tariffs being “too high,” particularly when it came to Chinese goods. “We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said Thursday in an earnings call. Trump responded on Saturday, posting to Truth Social that “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!” Trump’s comments echoed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s comments Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that “businesses and the countries primarily eat the tariff.” Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called such theories “ludicrous.” Economists have told CNN that the tariffs will burden lower- and middle-income Americans, who have historically been Walmart’s primary customer base. And consumers often go to the retail giant for non-negotiable purchases, such as groceries. “We have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won’t stop. We’ll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,” Walmart told CNN in a statement Saturday. Price changes at Walmart will likely take effect by the end of May and prices will increase “much more” in June, the company’s finance chief, John David Rainey, told CNBC. Walmart, which has over 4,600 stores in the United States, gets merchandise from Canada, China, India, Mexico and Vietnam, among other nations. Those countries face at least 10% in tariffs, and imports of steel, aluminum, cars and auto parts face 25% tariffs. “All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact,” McMillon said.

Walmart warns it will raise prices because of tariffs Trump increased tariffs on most Chinese goods to a whopping 145%, but that rate dropped to 30% on Monday as part of a 90-day truce with China. But Trump said the tariffs could become “substantially higher” if a trade agreement with China is not reached. Other countries are negotiating with the United States amid a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. Baseline tariffs will not go lower than 10% during negotiations, Lutnick told CNN on Sunday. Trump’s trade war has sunk consumer sentiment in recent months. The University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment fell 2.7% between April and May — a near-record low, in part due to Americans fearing a recession. Here’s what is expected to get more expensive at Walmart. “Food inflation is very much on our mind,” McMillon said. Bananas, avocados and coffee are among some of the groceries that McMillon said come from Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru. America also imports beets, cabbage, melons, and pineapples from Costa Rica. Sweet potatoes and citrus are imported from Peru. Walmart did not say how much prices could increase on fruits and vegetables. “We’ll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible,” McMillon said, suggesting that “controlling the amount of fresh food waste” could help. Between February and April, the average price of bananas per pound has increased by about 2 cents at US retailers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ryan Monarch, assistant professor of economics at Syracuse University, told CNN that seasonal and holiday shopping purchases can’t be delayed for two to three months to wait on the trade war to play out. Walmart is currently focused on back-to-school shopping, according to McMillon. He explained that tariffs are paid as soon as a product enters the country through customs, meaning the higher tariffs are already affecting shipments. “So I think what we’re looking at is upward pressure that began in April and plays through the entire year on things that are imported,” McMillon said. Estimating tariff costs and order quantities could “get more challenging” further down the line when making “decisions related to things like Halloween and Christmas,” he said. “China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys,” McMillon said. Roughly 80% of toys sold in the United States are made in China, according to the Toy Association, an industry group. Toy companies, like Hasbro, the owner of Nerf and Play-doh, said some items will be cut from its portfolio, and Barbie creator Mattel has issued warnings about potential price hikes due to tariffs. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,” Trump said earlier this month, acknowledging the potential impact tariffs will have on toys. Related article
Trump’s trade war is about to change the way you shop There has already been a jump in the price of toys. Product pricing analysis from research firm Telsey Advisory Groups showed that the price of a Barbie doll with a swimsuit sold at Walmart’s competitor Target rose 42.9% over a week in mid-April to $14.99. Gaming products should also see big price hikes. Initially priced at $450, Nintendo’s Switch 2 could instead cost around $600, according to experts. Even an Apple iPhone 17 could cost more than $1,000 instead of $799, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at investment firm Synovus. Childcare products, such as strollers, clothes, car seats and formula, could also see a price hike. Industry experts estimate that about 90% of children’s and baby gear products are manufactured exclusively in China, and that won’t change anytime soon. “Customers need those things. Even if they were to raise prices on those products, customers are still going to buy them,” Syracuse University’s Monarch said. “So you might expect products like that to see prices increasing pretty quickly.” In 2024, China sent more than $438 billion worth of goods into American homes. Nearly 19% of that total was machinery and mechanical appliances, according to data from the US International Trade Commission. Meanwhile, 4% of last year’s imports from China were bedding, furniture and lighting. Rainey, Walmart’s CFO, said general merchandise sales in the United States declined slightly during the first quarter, “with softness in electronics, home products and sporting goods.” Because home goods are not considered necessities like groceries and baby gear, consumers are more likely to hold off on buying them. “Consumers are very worried, and what they’re doing is they’re delaying their purchases of durable goods — things like cars, things like appliances,” said Monarch. Monarch added that Walmart was among companies to increase imports before tariffs took effect, allowing them to stock up on products that won’t perish.

CNN,Business,Edward Berthelot/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/business/labubu-doll-china-tariffs,"Naomi Lin’s favorite high-end accessory is wildly popular, an acquired taste, and shockingly resilient in the face of a tariff onslaught. No, it’s not Manolos or the latest offering from Prada — it’s a gremlin-like plush. It’s a Labubu, a palm-sized Nordic elf with bright eyes, sharp teeth and puckish grin. Lin, a medical student in Nebraska, owns dozens — and the one attached to her Chanel bag is dressed to the nines in a tweed outfit, matching headband and a mini “Chanel” purse. And Lin isn’t the only one captivated by Labubus’ ugly charm. Labubus are cute in the sense that they’re soft, miniature and come in a range of costumes you’d dress your baby in — a jack-o-lantern for Halloween, or a tiny pair of denim overalls. But they have glowering eyes and a jagged, sharp-toothed smile from ear to ear, an unblinking stare that would terrify anyone who caught its gaze in the middle of the night. The impish yet cute plushies are a global sensation among Gen Z and even those older, often hanging on handbags, backpacks and belt loops. People are flocking to shopping malls and waiting hours to purchase Labubus and their fellow creatures, who first appeared in “The Monsters” storybooks in 2015, in mystery “blind boxes,” meaning the buyer doesn’t know which one they’re getting in a given collection. The plushies’ distributor, China-based toy company Pop Mart, is enjoying meteoric growth both in the mainland and abroad in the US: In 2024, Labubus generated 3 billion yuan ($410 million) of Pop Mart’s 13.04 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in revenue. Labubus and other figurines distributed by the company have so far proven resistant to the tepid consumer sentiment in the US and the chaotic trade war between Washington and Beijing — and that growth hasn’t slowed. But it’s not just the size of the company’s sales, it’s their growth rate that’s more impressive. Pop Mart’s revenue outside China skyrocketed 375.2% to 5.07 billion yuan ($703 million) in 2024, and Citigroup research estimated Pop Mart’s revenue in America grew between 895% to 900% last year. Offline, Pop Mart’s brick-and-mortar stores from Los Angeles to Paris to Bangkok have infamously long lines, especially when new products are released. The growth is also fueled by a plethora of other figurines — there’s Baby Molly, Crybaby, Dimoo, Pucky and at least 30 more on the company’s US website. If you’re lucky enough to snag a Labubu, they can cost up to $85. Resellers on StockX are upcharging into the hundreds of dollars. And their fans are willing to splurge. Lin shelled out hundreds and spent hours on a TikTok Live to secure a Zimomo, a 22-inch creature with a spiked tail. “It’s in high demand, so it would be on par with a luxury item,” Lin said. Lin is not the only member of her family who is Pop Mart-obsessed. Her father, who bought Lin and her sister their first Labubus while visiting Taiwan, has a Crybaby plush on his suitcase. The meteoric growth of Pop Mart speaks to a larger history of Americans being attached to cute things from Asia (remember Hello Kitty?), Anne Cheng, an English professor at Princeton University, told CNN. Despite the push toward US-made products and the proliferation of anti-Asian sentiment during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growth trajectory for these toys just keeps going. Cheng said there’s always been hypocrisy in the US, where Asian people have faced bigoted stereotypes, but when the products they make “come in little boxable, consumable small bits, then they’re accessible.” Related article
A massive Trump tariff still exists on some of China’s cheapest exports The little gremlins, baby and creature keychains also offer a glimpse into luxury that is more attainable for most consumers. Celebrities have played a big role in making them a status symbol. K-pop megastar Lisa told Vanity Fair she got into blind boxes in early 2024 and “spent all my money” while jet-setting to different Pop Mart locations around the world. Oh, and Rihanna has a Labubu too. Some Labubu collections are certainly reminiscent of past crazes. But compared to luxurious collectibles, like say, designer bags or watches, toys that cost an average of $20 to $40 are not as expensive, and in uncertain times, people are looking for affordable indulgences. People are “looking for a fix and looking for anything to bring them joy,” said Ali Domrongchai, a food editor in New York City who just received her first Labubu as a gift this past year. Blind boxes are nothing new. The idea of buying something without knowing precisely what the package contains has driven many a craze, from baseball cards to video games. And the toy collective fanatics echo the Beanie Baby mania of the ’90s, or what it felt like checking which McDonald’s Happy Meal you got. Consumers who spoke to CNN all compared the immediate joy of opening a blind box to the high of gambling. China was so concerned about addiction that in 2023, it introduced strict regulation banning the sale of mystery boxes to children under 8 years old and requiring guardian consent for children who are older. “It plays into your desire for collecting things, then you keep buying them,” Cheng said. Pop Mart, like the majority of the toy industry, will almost certainly be impacted by President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. The US and China reached a 90-day truce this month, when the US lowered its 145% tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30%, and China reduced its 125% retaliatory tariffs to 10%. Related article
Labubu: The ‘kind of ugly’ plush toy that has taken the world by storm On its FAQ page, Pop Mart said that it will cover tariff-induced costs and that “customers will not be required to pay any additional customs fees.” But its latest release in April, a tie-dyed line of pastel-colored Labubus, cost $27.99 – $6 more than the previous one. CNN has reached out to Pop Mart for more details on how it plans to cover those tariff fees. Citigroup said it expects the company to accelerate diversifying its supply chain and raise prices in the US market, or prioritize expanding in other countries. In the meantime, Pop Mart’s stock, listed in Hong Kong, has been outperforming Tencent and Alibaba since the year began. For those who can’t get their hands on a real Labubu, there are knock-offs — often called lafufus or fauxbubus — but they’ll often have lower-quality fur or a slightly misshapen smile. And blind boxes aren’t exclusive to Pop Mart. Cute, kitschy items are a staple of East Asian culture, and Asian discount stores like Miniso and Daiso, which combined have hundreds of locations in the US, sell highly coveted blind box toys for under $5. And the bigger the market gets, the more likely it is that competitors will arise in China, the Citigroup analysts warned. And Lin’s Labubu, for the record, is not decked out in real Chanel. The toy’s outfit is from AliExpress, a source of cheap accessories for many Labubu fans. Domrongchai, the food editor in New York City, has been tuned into the hype: Her octogenarian great aunts have Labubus attached to their Louis Vuitton purses. And on a trip to visit family in Thailand last year, she visited “almost every mall in Bangkok” with her younger cousin to scour for the famous plush. But it was nowhere to be found, and $40 dollars for a toy is “an ungodly amount” for Thailand. Even for those who have managed to avoid the pull of the devilish smirk of a Labubu, there’s always a growing fan base attempting to turn them to the dark side. When a CNN reporter, a self proclaimed Sanrio and Miffy fan, confessed she found the monsters more unsettling than cute, Domrongchai was quick to encourage her: “They’re not that scary. They’re silly guys. Look, you need to spend some time with them.”",2025-05-18
CNN,Business,J. David Ake/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/moody-us-credit,"Moody’s Ratings downgraded the United States’ debt on Friday, stripping the country of its last perfect credit rating. The move could rattle financial markets and push up interest rates, potentially creating an additional financial burden for Americans already struggling with tariffs and inflation. Of the three major credit rating agencies, Moody’s was the lone holdout, maintaining its outstanding rating of AAA for US debt. Moody’s held a perfect credit rating for the United States since 1917. It now ranks US creditworthiness one notch below that, at Aa1, joining Fitch Ratings and S&P, which lowered their credit ratings for US debt in 2023 and 2011, respectively. The decision to downgrade debt was influenced by “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” Moody’s said in a statement. Moving forward, Moody’s said it expects borrowing needs to continue to grow and for it to weigh on the US economy as a whole. “The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden’s mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said on Friday. “If Moody’s had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.” A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to CNN. Moody’s initially put the United States on notice for a potential downgrade in November, at the time citing recent events that exemplified America’s extraordinary political divide. That included America’s near-default last summer and the resulting ouster of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the first time in history a speaker was given the boot during a legislative session, and Congress’ inability to cement a replacement for weeks. Moody’s said the US is is no immediate danger of being downgraded again: The credit-rating agency considers the US outlook “stable” in part because of “its long history of very effective monetary policy led by an independent Federal Reserve.” President Donald Trump, however, has recently raised questions of whether he’d continue to respect the central bank’s independence, and has previously threatened to fire Chair Jerome Powell. Aa1 is still quite strong, despite its notch below perfect. The ratings agency noted that America’s system of governance, albeit challenged, gives Moody’s confidence that the United States still deserves a near-perfect, if not AAA, credit rating. “The stable outlook also takes into account institutional features, including the constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of government that contributes to policy effectiveness over time and is relatively insensitive to events over a short period. While these institutional arrangements can be tested at times, we expect them to remain strong and resilient,” Moody’s said. The credit-rating agency said that increasing government revenue or reducing spending could restore America’s AAA rating. Trump has taken aim at the latter through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, resulting in thousands of federal government workers being laid off and the gutting of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). However, it’s unclear that such moves are changing the government’s borrowing needs. Already, the country is approaching a summer deadline for when the US could default on its debt unless the borrowing limit is raised, according to Treasury Department estimates. At the same time, Trump is pushing Congress to pass his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The package would cut taxes deeply – essentially making permanent the sweeping individual income tax provisions of Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as adding several temporary tax breaks to fulfill the president’s campaign promises. It also calls for historic cuts to the nation’s safety net – particularly Medicaid and food stamps – in an effort to cut spending. But the tax revenue loss would still swamp the spending reductions. The package would add $3.3 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next decade, according to a preliminary estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Annual deficits would jump from $1.8 trillion in 2024 to $2.9 trillion by 2034 as the federal government would continue to spend more than it would raise in revenue, the committee projected. Ballooning deficits, the unique US debt ceiling mechanism and political intransigence have been at the center of its downgrades from all three major credit ratings agencies. In 2011, S&P cited “political brinksmanship” and “America’s governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable.” In 2023, Fitch warned of the United States’ “fiscal deterioration,” its “high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance.” America was running a $1.3 trillion annual budget deficit in 2011, a number that has since risen to $1.8 trillion last year. Still, the Obama and Biden administrations lambasted both of those decisions. In 2023, Yellen said the decision was “arbitrary and based on outdated data.” US debt has long been considered by investors as the safest of safe havens, but Moody’s downgrade, along with Fitch’s and S&P’s suggests it has lost some of its luster. A downgrade would likely cause US Treasury yields to rise as investors see more risk in lending money to the government. US Treasuries – and particularly the 10-year US Treasury – influence all kinds of debt, from the mortgage rate for the houses Americans buy to contracts written around the world This is a developing story and will be updated.",2025-05-18
CNN,Business,Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Shutterstock,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/a-rogue-employee-was-behind-groks-unprompted-white-genocide-mentions,"Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company on Friday said a “rogue employee” was behind its chatbot’s unsolicited rants about “white genocide” in South Africa earlier this week. The clarification comes less than 48 hours after Grok — the chatbot from Musk’s xAI that is available through his social media platform, X — began bombarding users with unfounded genocidal theories in response to queries about completely off-topic subjects. In an X post, the company said the “unauthorized modification” in the extremely early morning hours Pacific time pushed the AI-imbued chatbot to “provide a specific response on a political topic” that violates xAI’s policies. The company did not identify the employee. “We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok’s transparency and reliability,” the company said in the post. To do so, xAI says it will openly publish Grok’s system prompts on GitHub to ensure more transparency. Additionally, the company says it will install “checks and measures” to make sure xAI employees can’t alter prompts without preliminary review. And the AI company will also have a monitoring team in place 24/7 to address issues that aren’t tackled by the automated systems. Nicolas Miailhe, co-founder and chief executive of PRISM Eval — an AI testing and evaluation start-up — told CNN that X’s proposed remedy is a mixed bag.”More transparency is generally better on this given the nature of the bot and platform (media),” Miailhe said. “Though detailed info about the system prompting can also be used by malicious actors to craft prompt injection attacks.” Musk, who owns xAI and currently serves as a top White House adviser, was born and raised in South Africa and has a history of arguing that a “white genocide” was committed in the nation. The billionaire media mogul has also claimed that white farmers in the country are being discriminated against under land reform policies that the South African government says are aimed at combating apartheid fallout. Less than a week ago, the Trump administration allowed 59 white South Africans to enter the US as refugees, claiming they’d been discriminated against, while simultaneously also suspending all other refugee resettlement. Per a Grok response to xAI’s own post, the “white genocide” responses occurred after a “rogue employee at xAI tweaked my prompts without permission on May 14,” allowing the AI chatbot to “spit out a canned political response that went against xAI’s values.” Notably, the chatbot declined to take ownership over its actions, saying, “I didn’t do anything — I was just following the script I was given, like a good AI!” While it’s true that chatbots’ responses are predicated on approved text responses anchored to their code, the dismissive admission emphasizes the danger of AI, both in terms of disseminating harmful information but also in playing down its part in such incidents. When CNN asked Grok why it had shared answers about “white genocide,” the AI chatbot again pointed to the rogue employee, adding that “my responses may have been influenced by recent discussions on X or data I was trained on, but I should have stayed on topic.” Over two years have passed since OpenAI’s ChatGPT made its splashy debut, opening the floodgates on commercially available AI chatbots. Since then, a litany of other AI chatbots — including Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Perplexity, Mistral’s Le Chat, and DeepSeek — have become available to US adults. A recent Gallup poll shows that most Americans are using multiple AI-enabled products weekly, regardless of whether they’re aware of the fact. But another recent study, this one from the Pew Research Center, shows that only “one-third of U.S. adults say they have ever used an AI chatbot,” while 59% of US adults don’t think they have much control over AI in their lives. CNN asked xAI whether the “rogue employee” has been suspended or terminated, as well as whether the company plans to reveal the employee’s identity. The company did not respond at the time of publication.",2025-05-18

CNN,Politics,"Getty Images, Reuters",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/trump-putin-ukraine-zelensky-talks,"Donald Trump will speak on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the Ukraine war, the US president announced. “THE SUBJECTS OF THE CALL WILL BE, STOPPING THE ‘BLOODBATH’ THAT IS KILLING, ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 5000 RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS A WEEK, AND TRADE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. The announcement comes after representatives from Ukraine and Russia held face-to-face talks in Turkey on Friday. It was the first time the two countries held direct talks at any level in three years. Trump has previously said he doesn’t think there will be a significant breakthrough on peace talks until he and Putin speak directly. “I don’t believe anything is going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,” Trump told reporters earlier this week. Trump said he plans to speak with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and various members of NATO after he talks with Putin. Related article
Russian attack on bus in Sumy region kills nine, Ukraine says, hours after peace talks “HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump wrote Saturday. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Saturday that preparations are underway for a phone conversation between Putin and Trump. “The conversation is being prepared,” Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS without providing further details. Ukraine, its allies in Europe and the US had pressured Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Putin denied that request and instead called for direct talks in Turkey between the nations, which Trump firmly urged Zelensky to accept. Zelensky, however, said he would go only if Putin showed up. The Russians sent a delegation that Zelensky deemed “low level,” and Putin did not show up for talks. Ukraine ultimately sent a delegation too, which led to the nations’ first talks since 2022, resulting in an agreement on swapping 1,000 prisoners. Trump told reporters while traveling in the Middle East earlier this week he didn’t expect Putin to show up to the talks in Turkey if he wasn’t there. “Look, nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK? And obviously he wasn’t going to go. He was gonna go, but he thought I was gonna go. He wasn’t going if I wasn’t there,” Trump said aboard Air Force One. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke Saturday to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stressing the US’ commitment to ending the conflict, according to State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. analysis
A whiplash week of diplomacy leaves Ukraine much where it started “Secretary Rubio welcomed the prisoner exchange agreement reached during the May 16 Ukraine-Russia talks in Istanbul and delivered President Trump’s strong message: the United States is committed to achieving a lasting end to the Russia-Ukraine war,” Bruce said in a statement. “The comprehensive peace plan proposed by the United States outlines the best way forward. The Secretary emphasized President Trump’s call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the violence.” After the call with Lavrov, Rubio posted on X, “The U.S. has presented a strong peace plan and we welcome the Prisoner of War exchange agreement reached in Istanbul. Let’s not miss this huge opportunity. The time for ending this war is now.” In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump said he is “tired” of other people negotiating the war and stressed how he and Putin need to meet. “He is at the table, and he wanted this meeting. And I always felt there can’t be a meeting without me, because I don’t think a deal is going to get through,” Trump said. “We have to get together, and I think we’ll probably schedule it, because I’m tired of having other people go and meet and everything else.” Trump was reluctant to cast the Russian president as the obstacle to peace with Ukraine, but he also told Fox News he thinks “Putin is tired of this whole thing.” “He’s not looking good, and he wants to look good,” Trump said. “Don’t forget, this was supposed to end in one week.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

CNN,Politics,Former FBI Director James Comey interviewed by the US Secret Service,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/politics/comey-interviewed-secret-service,"Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by US Secret Service agents at their Washington, DC, field office on Friday afternoon, according to law enforcement sources. Comey was interviewed by agents investigating a photo he posted to social media Thursday showing shells in the sand on a beach spelling out “86 47,” which has become a popular social media code for removing Trump from the presidency. Related article
Prosecuting James Comey for social media posts may be fruitless, legal and security experts say Comey was not in custody and appeared voluntarily, a source said. Comey told the Secret Service he and his wife were walking on the beach on Thursday when he saw the arranged shells, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said. Comey said they thought it was an address for a nearby property, but when he realized it was likely someone making a political statement, he snapped a photo and posted it, according to the source. Comey told the agents that a family member told him the post could possibly be interpreted as something sinister, so he deleted it, but he said he didn’t know “86” could mean violence and had no intention of threatening or harming Trump. Trump and fellow Republicans have attacked Comey for the post, demanding an investigation. Comey “knew exactly what that meant,” Trump said in a Fox News interview released Friday. “A child knows what that meant. If you’re the FBI director and you don’t know what that meant, that meant assassination.” In explaining why he removed the post, Comey wrote on Instagram that he had “posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message.” It was expected that Comey would be asked whether he intended the message as a threat, or to inspire others who might consider an act of violence against Trump, the first law enforcement source said. The law enforcement source close familiar with the case told CNN that Attorney General Pam Bondi told the Secret Service operations center Thursday night the case had to be presented to the US attorney first thing Friday before the scheduled interview. Ultimately, a decision on whether the case is chargeable as a threat against the president may lie with the US attorney in Washington. “The Secret Service vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees,” Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN. “We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.” Legally speaking, prosecuting Comey may be fruitless as any legal action would stand little chance, especially after a recent Supreme Court decision regarding threats and among a judiciary that has expanded free speech rights in recent years, legal experts say. “I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence,” Comey said Thursday of the number “86,” which can refer to something being tossed away or taken out. The corresponding “47” matches Trump’s current term in office as the 47th president. “It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.” A Secret Service source familiar with the investigation told CNN that under normal circumstances, such a post wouldn’t warrant a full-fledged investigation but under the current political climate will likely get more attention. Such an investigation, the source said, would serve as a distraction for agents in an organization already stretched thin. Another law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN the case is a “waste of our time. We’re strapped for resources but we’re investigating seashells.” This story has been updated with additional details.",2025-05-18
CNN,Politics,Nonprofit leaders brace for possible targeting by the Trump administration after tax measure advances in Congress,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/nonprofit-leaders-say-they-are-bracing-for-potential-targeting-by-the-trump-administration-after-a-controversial-tax-measure-advances-in-congress,"A House measure that would make it easier to yank the tax-exempt status of nonprofits the Trump administration deems as supporting terrorism marks the latest effort by the president and his Republican allies to hobble organizations that oppose his agenda, some nonprofit leaders argue. The provision comes as President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office in extraordinary ways to target top law firms, elite universities and other perceived political enemies. Last month, for instance, Trump directed his Justice Department to launch a probe of ActBlue, the main fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and liberal causes. The language – added this week by the House’s tax-writing committee to the massive “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that’s a top priority for Trump – would allow the Treasury secretary to suspend the tax-exempt status of organizations the administration says are “terrorist supporting.” More than 200 groups – ranging from the American Library Association to the Sierra Club – recently signed onto a public statement urging the House to remove the provision. They say it’s a tool for the president to take aim at his opponents. “We have seen this administration use every lever of power they have been able to grab to target the people they see as their enemies,” said Cole Leiter, executive director of Americans Against Government Censorship, one of the groups objecting to the House language. “This is a broad-based weaponization of government, and this is only the latest manifestation of that.” Nonprofit groups fear more is on the way – with a White House deadline looming for government agencies to identify large publicly traded corporations, foundations and nonprofits, universities and state and local bar and medical associations for potential civil investigations. In a statement, a White House official contended that Trump is operating within his rights and the law. “President Trump will always stand for law and order, ending the weaponization of the legal system, and rooting out fraud in the federal government,” said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields in an email to CNN, echoing the president’s familiar refrain that the Biden administration used the judicial system against him when Trump was out of office. “Every action he has taken in his second term reflects these priorities and is authorized by the Constitution,” Fields said. “Outside groups that ignored the previous administration’s egregious legal abuses against President Trump have no credibility today.” The tax provision, recently added to a nearly 400-page legislative proposal by the GOP-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, hews closely to language in a bill written by New York Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney that the House approved in the last Congressional session but did not pass the Senate. It would allow the Treasury secretary to suspend the tax-exempt status of charities the secretary determines have provided “material support or resources” to an organization the government has designated as a terrorist organization. Aides to Tenney and Ways and Means Chair Missouri Rep. Jason Smith did not respond to CNN’s inquiries about the measure. During floor debate on the Tenney bill last November, Smith said lawmakers have a “duty to make sure that taxpayers are not subsidizing terrorism.” Groups opposing the measure said it lacks adequate safeguards to protect organizations’ due-process rights. Kia Hamadanchy, a senior policy counsel with the ACLU, noted that it already is illegal to provide material support to a terrorist organization. The new provision, Hamadanchy said, is problematic because gives the Treasury secretary exclusive discretion to designate a group as terrorist-supporting and would allow the agency to suspend a nonprofit’s tax-exempt status “before you’ve had a chance to go before a neutral decision maker like a judge.” Lisa Gilbert – the co-president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen – said she fears organizations with international networks could unwittingly become ensnared should the provision become law. “Think about foreign humanitarian aid, for example, or groups that receive funds from foundations that are not solely based in the United States,” he said. “There is a lot of activity that could be swept up.” The White House referred questions about the bill’s language to the Treasury Department. A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment. Related video
GOP hardliner trashes Trump’s agenda bill The overall bill currently faces a rocky path in the House, although the chamber’s Republican leaders have said they want to bring it to the floor for a vote next week. A group of GOP hardliners on Friday blocked its passage in a key committee as they demanded steeper cuts and changes to its Medicaid provisions. If the bill passes the House, organizations opposed to the language regarding nonprofits’ tax status say they will fight to kill it in the Senate. The legislation deals with a range of the president’s priorities, from tax cuts to immigration enforcement. But to pass it through Congress, where Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers, GOP leaders are relying on a tool called budget reconciliation – allowing a simple majority to approve it without any Democratic votes. Under strict Senate rules, however, the chamber’s parliamentarian must determine whether its provisions have an actual impact on the budget, not merely an “incidental” one. An early analysis by a congressional joint taxation panel found the provision has a “negligible” effect in revenue, buoying opponents’ hopes that it could be stripped from the larger bill in the Senate. Federal law bars the president from ordering tax investigations of specific people or organizations, but Trump has publicly threatened to revoke the tax-exempt status of Harvard University for refusing to accede to his policy demands. In remarks last month about Harvard’s tax status, Trump indicated other organizations could be targeted, and singled out Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a nonprofit watchdog group that tackles public corruption and has sued the Trump administration over several of its actions. Some nonprofit leaders now are warily watching for other potential administration moves, arising from executive order that Trump signed January 21, aimed at encouraging the private sector to end what the administration deems as “illegal discrimination.” Among other things, the order directed agencies to identify up to nine potential targets among foundations, corporations, colleges and other entities, for “civil compliance” probes as part of the administration’s effort to root out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility policies. Groups that could be subjected to scrutiny include what the order calls “large” nonprofits and associations, foundations with assets of at least $500 million and colleges and universities with endowments that top $1 billion. Attorney General Pam Bondi already has directed the department’s Civil Rights Division to review whether universities are trying to skirt a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that said schools could no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission. A Justice Department task force aimed at combatting antisemitism on campuses is also investigating nearly a dozen universities and the entire University of California system. Trump’s Jan. 21 order also calls on the attorney general to issue a report to the White House recommending actions within 120 days – a deadline that will arrive next week. But it’s not clear whether lists of potential targets have been assembled or will be released publicly. A DOJ spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry about the report. Even so, leaders of nonprofit groups are having conversations with their lawyers and looking for ways to avoid risks and prepare for potential audits, several people familiar with internal discussions tell CNN. “People are trying to brace for it,” said Gilbert of Public Citizen. “It’s very unclear what it will mean to be on a list in Trump’s America.” CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.",2025-05-18
CNN,Politics,Device that makes semi-automatic rifles fire quicker allowed by Trump administration,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/device-allows-rifles-fire-quicker,"President Donald Trump’s administration agreed on Friday to permit the sale of a device that allows for semi-automatic rifles to be fired quicker, a decision that gun control activists say paves the way for more mass shootings. The Department of Justice announced the agreement as part of a settlement between the federal government and gun manufacturer Rare Breed Triggers, in litigation brought by the Biden administration. “This Department of Justice believes that the 2nd Amendment is not a second-class right,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in the statement. “And we are glad to end a needless cycle of litigation with a settlement that will enhance public safety.” Forced-reset triggers (FRT) allow a semi-automatic rifle to be fired at an increased rate by automatically resetting the trigger after each shot. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) classified them as illegal machine guns in 2022 under the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934. Machine guns have been heavily regulated by Congress since the NFA was passed, and the manufacture for civilian use was banned completely under the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986, a bill endorsed by the National Rifle Association.

Children and teens are more likely to die by guns than anything else The Justice Department brought a lawsuit in New York in 2023 against Rare Breed Triggers, which made and distributed such devices, leading to a court ruling blocking it from selling them. While the case was pending, the National Association of Gun Rights (NAGR) filed a separate lawsuit in Texas challenging the ban and a judge there ruled the ban was unlawful. The latest settlement resolves those disputes and falls in line with Trump’s February executive order on protecting the Second Amendment’s “right to bear arms,” the Justice Department said in its statement. “This decision marks a new era of holding the DOJ and ATF accountable when they trample the rights of law-abiding gun owners,” NAGR President Dudley Brown said in a release. “We made them give back what they took, and that’s a precedent they’ll never forget.” The DOJ also said the settlement includes “agreed-upon conditions” concerning public safety with respect to FRTs, including that Rare Breed will not develop or design FRTs for use in any pistol and will enforce its patents. Rare Breed also agreed to promote the safe and responsible use of its products, the DOJ said. CNN has reached out to Rare Breed Triggers for comment on the settlement. Democratic lawmakers and gun control groups have widely condemned the decision. Vanessa Gonzalez, a Vice President with GIFFORDS, the national gun violence prevention group led by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, said in a statement the Trump administration “effectively legalized machine guns.” “This is an incredibly dangerous move that will enable shooters to inflict horrific damage,” Gonzalez said. “The only people who benefit from these being on the market are the people who will make money from selling them, everyone else will suffer the consequences.” The national gun control advocacy group, Brady United, said the settlement means “highly dangerous weapons of war can now be purchased anonymously” and without a background check. “The Trump’s Administration’s secret settlement with the gun lobby to permit the sale of Forced Reset Triggers will turn already deadly firearms into weapons of mass destruction,” President of Brady, Kris Brown, said in the statement. “(It) is not only an astonishing abuse of power, but undermines decades of sensible government gun safety policy and puts whole communities at immediate serious risk.”",2025-05-18
CNN,Politics,Social Security drops controversial anti-fraud review amid growing claims backlog,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/social-security-anti-fraud-policy,"A month after instituting a controversial anti-fraud policy that sparked widespread concern among senior citizens, the Social Security Administration has quietly dropped a key piece of the measure. The agency will no longer hold retirement benefit applications for three days to check for fraud, according to an email sent to workers and reviewed by CNN. The decision comes as the backlog in retirement benefit claims has swelled to nearly 575,000 applications, and employees, whose ranks have thinned from downsizing efforts, are being encouraged to work harder to process those claims. Pushed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, the anti-fraud policy was revised several times before being implemented amid an outcry from advocates for senior citizens and people with disabilities. Originally, the agency wanted to bar applicants from filing for benefits over the telephone, arguing that it could not do sufficient identity verification. Instead, people would have had to confirm their identities through their online “my Social Security” account or visit a field office to complete the claim in person. Advocates feared that the policy would make it harder for many folks to file for claims, particularly if they are not computer-savvy or live far from the agency’s offices. The policy change, along with a related one ending beneficiaries’ ability to update their direct deposit information over the phone, prompted senior citizens and people with disabilities to flood the agency’s phone lines and field offices with concerns. Many thought they had to prove their identities to continue receiving payments or had questions about the new procedures. Related article
Are changes at the Social Security Administration concerning you? Share your story with us Less than two weeks later, Social Security announced that the anti-fraud policy would only apply to those filing for retirement, survivors or family benefits over the phone, and its rollout would be delayed by two weeks to April 14. The phone claims would be subject to a fraud review, and if irregularities were detected, applicants would have to go to a field office to prove their identity. Asked about the latest change in policy, a Social Security spokesperson said the agency “continues to refine the anti-fraud algorithm to flag only the claims with the highest probability of fraud. Continuous improvements will ensure timely processing of claims while protecting beneficiaries from fraud.” However, the review process only found two cases – out of more than 110,000 claims – that had a high probability of being fraudulent, according to an internal document obtained by Nextgov/FCW, which covers technology in federal agencies. Fewer than 1% of claims were flagged as potentially fraudulent. What’s more, the anti-fraud checks delayed the processing of retirement claims by 25% and led to worse customer service, according to the May document. “It created a problem in customer service where one didn’t exist, and it didn’t do anything to prevent fraud,” said Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who worked at the agency during the Biden administration. As of mid-May, Social Security had nearly 575,000 pending retirement claims, with about 140,000 of them languishing for at least 60 days, according to an email from Stephen Evangelista, Social Security’s deputy commissioner for operations, that was sent to employees and viewed by CNN. He noted that the agency is receiving a record number of claims this year for several reasons, including the peak wave of Baby Boomers hitting retirement age and a law passed by Congress that beefed up Social Security benefits for nearly 3 million federal, state and local workers. The backlog began increasing swiftly last fall, shooting up from fewer than 350,000 pending claims in September to nearly 600,000 pending claims in April, according to Social Security data posted online. Evangelista urged workers in the field offices and another unit to “do their very best” to increase the number of retirement claims they clear every day by at least 10% for the rest of May. “I am calling for a sprint – a focused, concerted effort in all offices beginning today and lasting through the end of May – to address this growing backlog of pending retirement and survivor claims,” he wrote. The missive did not go over well with many employees, said Joel Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3184, which represents workers in nearly 100 agency offices across the South and Southwest. Social Security is in the midst of culling about 7,000 workers, or roughly 12%, from its staff – offering two rounds of deferred resignation offers, as well as other buyout and early retirement incentives. Multiple field offices have lost sizeable shares of their staff. And while the agency is reassigning about 1,000 employees from headquarters and regional offices to work in field offices and other mission-critical units, it will take time to train them. “Employees find it to be another sign of disrespect from an out-of-touch agency leadership,” Smith said of the directive. Workers “weren’t looking for another demotivational email from an agency leadership that cut their telework, encouraged them to quit and created an unnecessary backlog.”",2025-05-18
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,A24,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/entertainment/eddington-pedro-pascal-cannes-film-festival,"Ari Aster is currently living in a state of blissful ignorance. It won’t last long. The director of “Midsommar” and “Beau Is Afraid,” who has brought his politically volatile work “Eddington” to the Cannes Film Festival, admits he hasn’t seen any of the online reactions to his movie. “I’ve been very deliberately avoiding the discourse about the film,” he told CNN during a packed and often impassioned press conference at the festival on Saturday. “I’ll probably dip my head into the swamp and see what the f***’s going on in there, or something, but I haven’t done it yet.” “Eddington,” starring Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler, is set in small-town New Mexico during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Phoenix’s sheriff is baffled by mask policies and the apparent hysteria among the townspeople, while Pascal’s mayor is toeing the line (while also making dubious business deals with big tech to build a data center on the town’s outskirts). Their contretemps predates the pandemic, rooted in their relationships with the sheriff’s wife, an aloof, clearly depressed Emma Stone. The small-town drama is pulled wider by news events, namely the death of George Floyd and the protests movement that followed. Aster shoehorns all manner of hot-button topics: identity politics, social media silos, false flag attacks, and the allure of conspiracy theories, all facilitated by the wholesale erosion of truth in the digital age. The film is proving a potent Rorschach test. Less than 24 hours after it premiered, there’s already plenty of online chatter about where “Eddington’s” own politics stand, with commentators of all stripes – some sight unseen – making the case it speaks for them. “I wanted to paint a picture of the society that we’re now living in,” said Aster. “And I didn’t want to attach myself to one ideology or one story or one belief system, because it’s too narrow. That’s not the point, y’know? The film is designed to be ambiguous in certain ways.” “What the film is about, for me, is about what happens when people who are so isolated and are living in their own realities – what happens when they come into conflict with each other,” Aster explained. “When you start bumping up against each other, a new logic is created, and out of that, people start amplifying each other’s fears.” Earlier at the press conference, the director discussed how the project began. “I wrote this film in a state of fear and anxiety about the world,” he said. “I wanted to try and pull back and just describe and show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore.” “I feel over the last 20 years we’ve fallen into this age of hyper-individualism … that social force that used to be kind of central to liberal mass democracies – which is an agreed upon version of the world – that is gone now,” he added. “Covid felt like the moment where that length was finally cut for good,” Aster said. “I wanted to make a film about just what America feels like to me and what it felt like to me at that time.” Journalists pressed the actors and director more than once on the current state of America. One questioned if actors had fears of reprisals for making movies with political messages. “Fear is the way that they win,” said Pascal. “So keep telling the stories, keep expressing yourself, and keep fighting to be who you are. And f—k the people that try to make you scared, y’know? And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so, in telling stories. And don’t let them win.” Pascal, answering another question about Latin American migrants, recounted his youth:“My parents are refugees for Chile. I myself was a refugee. We fled a dictatorship. And I was privileged enough to grow up in the US after asylum in Denmark. And if it weren’t for that, I don’t know what would have happened to us. And so I stand by those protections,always.” Another journalist went as far as to ask if there was “nothing left but civil war waiting for America.” “I don’t speak English,” Aster quipped, before eventually answering. “I think we’re on a dangerous road, and I feel like we’re living through an experiment that is going wrong – it’s gone wrong. It’s not going well and it feels like there’s no way out of it … (It) should probably be stopped or paused because it’s not working, but it’s clear that nobody’s actually interested in stopping it.” Related article
Robert De Niro hits out at Trump in Cannes speech Cannes is no stranger to mixing art of politics. The seminal 1968 edition featured protests spearheaded by director Jean-Luc Godard, which forced the festival to shut down. (Time proved kind to Godard of course, who will be venerated once more at Cannes this year with Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” which retraces the new wave director’s efforts to get 1960 film “À Bout de Souffle” made.) The 78th edition, the first since President Donald Trump’s return to office, has already, and perhaps inevitably, kept one eye on the news. On the opening night, Robert De Niro, receiving an honorary Palme d’Or, hit out Trump, labelling him a “philistine president.” “In my country, we are fighting like hell for the democracy we once took for granted,” he told an audience made up of the great and good of the international film community.

CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Eli Adé/Warner Bros.,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/entertainment/sinners-movie-black-america-cec,"White supremacy. Nope. Can’t use those words anymore. Racism? Old news. The racial reckoning took care of that years ago. Diversity, equity and… Hush. Now you about to get us in some serious trouble. It’s a tough time to talk about racism in America. The country is in the midst of a Woke Scare in which the mere mention of terms like “racism” or “diversity” invites retribution. Teachers have been fired, books banned and universities investigated for invoking those terms. The acronym DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) has become what the author George Saunders calls an “omni-pejorative,” an all-purpose slur that is “deliberately vague.” It’s no wonder that some Black commentators warn that America is entering a second “nadir,” a term used to describe a low point in race relations that began in the late 1800s and carried into the early 20th century. It was a time when blatant racism was common among White political leaders, and lynchings were routine. What can a person who cares about racial justice do to get heard in today’s grim racial climate? Make a vampire movie. That’s what filmmaker Ryan Coogler has done with “Sinners,” a horror movie that’s become a cultural phenomenon while earning more than $220 million at the domestic box office since its release last month. (The film is produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) “Sinners,” which follows Black twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who open a juke joint in rural Mississippi during the Great Depression, has earned a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praise the film’s blend of vampires and Black folklore, offering an array of explanations for its success. Black moviegoers have turned out in large numbers to see it. But there’s another, more frightening reason why “Sinners” is resonating — one that most critics have missed. Darkened movie theaters are among the few public spaces left in America where Black people feel free to vicariously express their horror over the recent, head-spinning changes to the country’s racial climate. Many successful films, TV series, songs and other entertainments mine the untapped emotions of their audiences. “Sinners” is no different. Consider two recent events that occurred soon after the film’s release in mid-April: In addition, two seismic developments have driven a stake into the heart of the 2025 racial justice movement. In his second term, President Trump, who has a history of making racist public statements, has waged war on DEI efforts within the government and in public schools and universities. And the Black Lives Matter movement has been neutered by questions over the organization’s financial transparency and allegations of corruption, along with the inevitable “Whitelash” that follows any racial progress in America. I’ve witnessed this despair myself. I have never seen such a widespread feeling of hopelessness among my Black friends and family. “Sinners” is set in the Mississippi Delta in 1932, but part of its appeal are its nods to today’s bleak racial landscape. There are clever references to colorism, mass incarceration and a White vampire who claims he’s a victim of reverse racism. In the film, every movement toward interracial unity is seen as a deadly trap. “We believe in equality,” says the film’s lead villain Remmick (Jack O’Connell), while flashing a vulpine grin to a group of skeptical Black juke joint patrons. “Can’t we be for one night family?” he asks. We can’t, Coogler’s movie implies. There’s not a single sympathetic White character in the film. That’s the movie’s unspoken message: White America sucks the life out of Black culture, dangling promises of equality that can never be. I watched “Sinners” in a theater filled with Black people. There I saw something I hadn’t seen since my father snuck me into theaters when I was a boy to watch 1970s “Blaxploitation” films like “Superfly” and “Blacula.” When a Black character in “Sinners” dispatched a racist White character at point-blank range in a particularly gruesome way, many people in the audience whooped and applauded. “We was never going to be free,” a Black character tells another near the end of the film, after their lofty plans fail. “Sinners” does offer plenty of Black Joy. There are scenes depicting the beauty and resilience of Black culture — the sweaty transcendence of our music; the West African spirituality that we blended with Christianity to make something new; the playfully raucous way Black folks talk to one another when White folks ain’t around. For 2 hours and 17 minutes, Black people and their allies can sit in a darkened theater and still believe that Black lives matter. They can escape into a story where Black characters affirm their anger and disenchantment — and not have to worry about getting fired, arrested or losing their funding. And yet this is one of the most frightening movies I’ve ever seen — not because of anything on screen, but because of its undercurrent of Black despair. “Nothing could be a more terrifying backdrop for a story involving creatures of the night than a world already determined to ignore your screams for help,” wrote critic Cuba Jimenez in an essay about the movie. That sentiment is the other monster that stalks the screen in “Sinners” — the kind of despair can’t be stopped by garlic or a crucifix. Screenings of “Sinners” may be one of the few public places left where Black Americans can freely express their emotions. And that’s more chilling than any drooling monster a filmmaker can conjure.

CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Mike Lawrie/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/entertainment/trump-springs-teen,"President Donald Trump had some words for The Boss. In a Friday morning Truth Social post, the president criticized Bruce Springsteen for “go[ing] to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States.” The president’s comments come days after Springsteen lambasted Trump during the first show of his latest tour with the E Street Band. Speaking at the Manchester-based concert on Wednesday, Springsteen branded the Trump administration “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous,” calling on “all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us.” “Raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring,” Springsteen said at the Mancunian show. The setlist was a marked departure from the band’s post-pandemic shows. While the last few years have seen Springsteen play a mostly autobiographical, introspective set devoid of the political statements that have been the hallmarks of his career, the performance on Wednesday — Springsteen’s first since Trump returned to the Oval Office — included several. A representative for Springsteen did not respond to a request for comment after Trump’s social media post. Trump’s Truth Social post also saw the president accuse Springsteen of “not (being) a talented guy,” an ironic allegation given Trump previously featured the rocker’s “Born in the U.S.A.” at multiple rallies without Springsteen’s consent. The post also slammed Springsteen for speaking out against the president while abroad rather than while on US soil. “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare,’” Trump wrote. “Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!” Springsteen has supported and campaigned for several Democratic candidates throughout his career.

The limited-run play’s penultimate performance from the Winter Garden Theatre in New York will air live on CNN and CNN International and stream on CNN.com at 7 p.m. ET. “This announcement marks a historic Broadway first: never before has a live play ever been televised,” the network said in a news release. The show is an adaptation of the 2005 movie Clooney directed of the same name and is based on veteran journalist Edward R. Murrow’s work and tension with Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare of the 1950s. The play, which debuted in March, swiftly shattered weekly records, becoming the highest-grossing play in Broadway history. It has also earned five Tony Award nominations, including Clooney for best leading actor in a play. “I can’t tell you how exciting it is to do something that’s never been done. CNN is the perfect place to bring this story of courage to so many more people than we could have ever hoped. Live TV. No net. Buckle up everyone,” Clooney said in the news release. Discussing the play in a previous interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Clooney stressed the importance of journalism in preserving democracy, citing the veteran journalist’s words. “It doesn’t matter what political bend you are on – when you hear things like, you know, ‘We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and a conviction depends on evidence and due process of law, and we will not walk in fear of one another. We won’t be driven by fear into an age of unreason,’ I think those are extraordinarily powerful words for who we are at our best,” Clooney said. The play comes at a time when the Trump administration has launched attacks on media, including barring the Associated Press from some of President Donald Trump’s events and attempting to end federal funding for NPR and PBS. Clooney – a major Democratic donor – has repeatedly spoken out against Trump. And ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraising for then-President Joe Biden before Biden’s disastrous performance at CNN’s presidential debate that ultimately led him to drop out of the race. According to a forthcoming book from Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, Biden did not recognize Clooney – whom he had known for years – at the fundraiser, leaving the actor “shaken to his core.” Less than a month after the interaction, Clooney released an op-ed calling for Biden to drop out of the race.",2025-05-18
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/entertainment/chris-brown-arrest-custody-uk-intl,"Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown’s upcoming tour was thrown into question Friday as a British judge ordered him held in custody while facing allegations that he beat a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023. Brown, 36, appeared in Manchester Magistrates’ Court to face one count of causing grievous bodily harm and was ordered held until his next hearing June 13 in London – the same day he’s due to take the stage in Frankfurt, Germany, on the third date of his world tour. Judge Joanne Hirst rejected Brown’s bail request after prosecutor Hannah Nicholls said that the crime was “extremely serious.” Brown was on tour in the UK in February 2023 when he is alleged to have attacked producer Abe Diaw with a bottle at the Tape nightclub, in London’s Mayfair neighborhood. Defense attorney Grace Forbes argued that the American performer wasn’t a flight risk and should be released. Brown was flanked by court officers in the dock. His hair was bleached blonde and he wore sweatpants and a black T-shirt. He confirmed his name and birth date, and said that his address was the local Lowry Hotel, where he was arrested early Thursday and taken into custody. His case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court in London, where he is expected to enter a plea to the charge. Brown’s representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as “Run It,” “Kiss Kiss” and “Without You.” He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for “F.A.M.E.” and then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for “11:11 (Deluxe)” earlier this year.

And it all started with one player – Scottie Scheffler. The World No. 1 is back to doing things on the golf course that are expected. The 28-year-old propelled himself onto the top of the leaderboard after shooting a blistering 6-under 65 on the day, leaving him with a 11-under par for the tournament. He sits three strokes ahead of Alex Noren, who shot 5-under par in Saturday’s third round to put himself at 8-under par for the tournament. Scheffler is now 18 holes away from doing something he has never done – winning a major that isn’t the Masters. The two-time major winner has won at Augusta National twice in 2022 and 2024. Scheffler said it would “mean a lot” to bring home a third major championship. “These tournaments are very important to us, and you work your whole life to have a chance to win major tournaments, any tournament for that matter, and tomorrow I have a good opportunity to go out there and try and win the golf tournament,” Scheffler told CNN’s Patrick Snell after the round. “But it’s going to take another really good round. There’s a lot of great players chasing me on the leaderboard and someone is going to put up a great round and it’s up to me to go out there and have another really good round and finish off the tournament. Looking forward to the challenge.” Scheffler would become the 48th player in golf history to win three or more majors. Scheffler and Noren will tee off together on Sunday at 2:40 p.m. ET. The first two rounds saw an unlikely name claim the top of the leaderboard. Jhonattan Vegas. After becoming the first Venezuelan to hold the lead or co-lead in a major, Vegas looked to claim his first win in one of golf’s most prized tournaments. Saturday turned out to more of a struggle than not for the 40-year-old. Vegas shot 2-over par to tumble the leaderboard to a tie for fifth place with LIV Golf star Jon Rahm and Si Woo Kim. Despite sitting five-strokes back of Scheffler, Vegas can still accomplish something he has never done in his golf career. Getting his first top 20 finish at a major. “That’s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world,” Bryson DeChambeau told reporters after Saturday’s third round that saw his lead quickly disapear as quickly as it came. The LIV Golf star walked onto the 16th hole tee box with the outright lead at hand after sinking five birdies in the round to get to 8-under par and a one-stroke lead over Vegas and Davis Riley at the time. However, Quail Hollow’s infamous “Green Mile” ate him up and spit him back out which resulted in that lead going away and potentially never coming back. A bogey on the 16th, a double bogey on the 17th saw him fall to 5-under par and sit in a tie for 8th place entering Sunday’s final round. DeChambeau said the wind factored in the poor finish to the round but added he will “control what he can control” with quite a bit of ground to catch up. “It was just an unfortunate series of events that I can handle. It’s just, it’s golf. Sometimes that happens,” DeChambeau said. The 31-year-old will tee off with Tony Finau at 2 p.m. ET.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/18/sport/green-mile-quail-hollow-pga-championship-spt,"They say the Masters doesn’t really get going until the second nine on Sunday. The coveted Green Jacket has been won and lost many times over the years especially when the iconic three holes known as Amen Corner loom large. At Quail Hollow – the host venue for this year’s PGA Championship – there’s another trio of holes that have been conspiring to make plenty in the field here in North Carolina sweat profusely. And it’s not just down to the sweltering temperatures out there on the course! The last three holes at this famous Charlotte venue are known as the Green Mile. For some, it’s one of the most difficult closing sequence of holes in the sport. In total, they measure just under 1,250 yards. The par-4 16th is a gargantuan 529 yards. It’s followed by a 223-yard par-3 and the closing hole – also a par 4 – comes in at 494 yards. Water is a clear and present danger across all three holes. Simply put, it’s a brutal test of every golfer’s resolve and patience. Just ask Bryson DeChambeau. He was at 8-under par and making a real charge late in the day Saturday before the perils of the Green Mile kicked in. After two straight birdies, then came a bogey at 16 and a double bogey at 17. ”It was just a tale of the wind going into me instead of downwind. It cost me three shots and that’s what happens here at Quail Hollow,” the US Open champion said. The 31 year-old, who plays on the LIV Golf circuit, doesn’t feel he did a whole lot wrong en route to a 2-under par third round 69 which only served to increase his frustrations. ”That’s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world,” DeChambeau lamented. The top-ranked player in the men’s game is Scottie Scheffler. But even he is well aware of the threat posed by the Green Mile, although he navigated it well on Saturday as he powered his way into a three shot lead. “The approach shot into 16 is really tough. The tee shot on 17 is really tough. Then you’ve got 2 really challenging shots on 18 with the water on the left side,” Scheffler said. “There’s no real breathers in that stretch of holes and should make for a fun finish.” Fun is perhaps not the word Scheffler would have chosen after Thursday’s opening round during which he, the recently-crowned Masters champion Rory McIIroy and this tournament’s defending champion Xander Schauffele all double-bogeyed 16, albeit while battling demanding course conditions following the deluge of rain earlier in the week. McIIroy knows this course like the back of his hand. He’s won four times at Quail Hollow during his storied career but even he found himself having to avoid a double bogey at the last on Friday to stay in the tournament for the weekend. In the end, the five-time Major winner achieved his goal but only after a bogey following one at 17 too. Or take the plight of Justin Thomas who was the winner the last time the PGA Championship was played at Quail Hollow in 2017. Thomas – who won recently in South Carolina – failed to make the cut after two untimely bogeys in his last three holes. The Green Mile is not all doom and gloom though. It can even at times provide players with a big break when it comes to a stray rake. That was the experience of Venezuela’s Jhonattan Vegas who led the tournament through the first two rounds. On Friday, the South American’s drive at 17 was well off target before it struck a rake near a greenside bunker and then flew onto the green from where he would save par. “It was one of those things that happens in the sport. Sometimes you get a sprinkler head that goes out-of-bounds or the cart path that goes out-of-bounds or sometimes you hit a rake that goes on the green,” the four-time PGA Tour winner reflected. “It’s just part of the game, and you’ve just got to enjoy it all,” he added. Or how about the Ryan Gerard approach? The young American is playing in his first PGA Championship in his home state too. Gerard attended the University of North Carolina and as a college golfer, there was one sure way to try and conquer that daunting close hole at Quail Hollow. “I’ll give you a fun anecdote. In 2018, so six months after the PGA, we came out here as preparation for the NCAA nationals, and our coach made all six of us go on 18 tee and everyone had to play the 18th hole until all six made a par and at the same time in the same group,” the 25 year-old told reporters. “So, we were out there for quite a while. I learned a lot about the 18th hole on that day, and I hope that carries forward into this week.” There’s no question other factors will come into play during what’s sure to be a tension-filled final round but we can be sure of one thing. It’s highly likely Quail Hollow’s notoriously demanding finishing stretch will go a long way in determining who will lift the famed Wanamaker Trophy come Sunday evening.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Justin Setterfield/The FA/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/sport/crystal-palace-manchester-city-fa-cup-final-spt-intl,"Crystal Palace has won its first major trophy after beating Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final on Saturday. For Manchester City and Pep Guardiola, the final loss represents a first trophyless season since the 2016-17 campaign. Oliver Glasner’s side took the lead in the first half at Wembley Stadium in London when Eberechi Eze finished off a customary Crystal Palace counterattack. Manchester City piled on the pressure for the remainder of the game and will regret passing on missed opportunities throughout – including a missed penalty from Omar Marmoush. Crystal Palace took the lead in the 16th minute with a free-flowing goal its fans have grown accustomed to seeing during Glasner’s time in charge of the club. The South London team went from back-to-front in lightning speed with a trademark counterattack. Jean-Philippe Mateta held the ball up on the halfway line before finding full-back Daniel Muñoz galloping down Palace’s right-hand side with one of his customary bursts. Muñoz looked up before delivering a low cross into the Manchester City box which found the onrushing Eze perfectly. The 26-year-old then swept the ball into the far corner of the net and sent the Crystal Palace fans into a state of delirium. Manchester City dominated before the goal and continued to pile on the pressure at 1-0 down. Guardiola’s team was soon rewarded for its constant pressure when Bernardo Silva was brought down by Tyrick Mitchell in the Crystal Palace penalty area. Marmoush stepped up to take the spot kick for Manchester City but saw his penalty brilliantly saved by Dean Henderson in the Palace goal. Crystal Palace went in at the halftime break with a 1-0 lead, knowing it was 45 minutes from making history. The second half saw more of the same with Crystal Palace defending doggedly to prevent a Manchester City equalizer. Henderson continued to prove his worth in the Palace net, thwarting Manchester City efforts on countless occasions. As time ran out, Manchester City ran out of ideas and Crystal Palace held on to seal a historic win for the club. “It’s special,” matchwinner Eze told BBC Sport after the game. “I don’t even know what to say.” Crystal Palace came into the game as heavy underdogs. The club had never won a major trophy in its long history and was facing a side which has dominated English football in recent years. Manchester City has won the Premier League six times since the 2017-18 season, alongside a host of other major honors. But this Crystal Palace team did not let the history books distract them from the task at hand. “I think that’s what’s amazing is that we can do something nobody in Crystal Palace history has done,” Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards told CNN Sports’ Darren Lewis prior to the final. And Crystal Palace did just that, making history thanks to Eze’s goal. The American defender also told Lewis of Eze’s importance to the team. “He does things out here that nobody would expect – I don’t even have the creativity in my brain to think of some of the stuff that he does,” Richards said of his talismanic teammate. “He’s one of those guys who leads by example. He doesn’t have too much to say but when he does say it you understand that it’s probably coming from a good place.” Not only does this win represent a first major honor for Crystal Palace, but the club will now also be playing in Europe for the first time in its history next season. Celebrations of Crystal Palace fans will last deep into the night after breaking its long drought and will surely now continue around the continent next season.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Kim Klement/USA Today Sports/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/sport/antonio-brown-detained-after-gunshots-spt,"Miami (AP) — Antonio Brown was briefly detained by police early Saturday following an altercation in which gunshots were fired outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami, according to the former NFL star and video posted to social media. Miami police confirmed in a written statement that officers responded to the area at about 3 a.m. after receiving an alert from the gunshot-detection system ShotSpotter. Officer Kiara Delva, a department spokeswoman, said police questioned several people but made no arrests. No injuries were reported at the scene. The investigation continues, Delva said, and she could not confirm the names of anyone involved. Video posted to social media showed Brown involved in a fight with several people at the boxing event, which was hosted by popular streamer Adin Ross. He was seen apparently holding a black pistol as he pursued someone. Shots could be heard off camera shortly thereafter. Additional video showed Brown, hands behind his back, being escorted from the venue by an officer. Brown posted on social media that he had been “jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.” “Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED,” Brown wrote. Brown’s statement did not mention the gunshots. Brown played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010 to 2018, where he emerged as one of the NFL’s top receiving threats and twice led the league in receiving yards. His career took a downturn because of various on- and off-field issues, including his contract being voided by the Oakland Raiders before the start of the 2019 season. He split his final three NFL seasons with New England and Tampa Bay, and his career ended with Brown stripping off his jersey, pads and gloves, while walking off the field during the Buccaneers’ 2021 regular-season finale against the New York Jets. Brown announced his retirement a few months later.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Rob Carr/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/sport/journalism-wins-150th-preakness-stakes-spt,"The favorite Journalism came from behind to the finish line first Saturday to win the 150th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. Journalism edged Gosger by a half-length in a thrilling race that had no Triple Crown implications. Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty did not compete in the second leg of the three races that make up the Triple Crown. The colt instead is preparing for the Belmont Stakes on June 7. Journalism, ridden by Umberto Rispoli and trained by Michael McCarthy, entered the field of nine horses at 6-5 odds. Journalism was bumped by Goal Oriented as the horses rounded the far turn before Journalism regained some momentum. But down the stretch, it appeared Journalism would have another second-place Triple Crown finish. Journalism was the runnerup at the Kentucky Derby on May 3. But the three-year-old closed out strong, blowing passed Gosger, a 15-1 longshot, in the end. Rispoli reflected on his first career Preakness mount. “When I first came to the United States, you can’t really realize what the Triple Crown means until you go with a favorite horse to ride at the Kentucky Derby,” Rispoli said in an NBC post-race interview. “I can tell you, I couldn’t sleep for four nights after the Kentucky Derby.” He added: “This take some of the pain off and I’m glad to have this opportunity. I had to wait 20 years, but it was worth the wait.” McCarthy picked up his second career Preakness victory and thought that there would be another second place ending when Journalism was behind. “When I saw that, I kind of resided myself to the fact that it was another fantastic effort, maybe come up a little short but it goes to show the testament that this horse has, couldn’t be prouder of him. “In the back of mind, I thought we’d be two for two here but you know what, just happy to get one of these. They are very, very difficult races to win.” Sandman finished third. Saturday’s race was the last one at historic Pimlico as ‘Old Hilltop’ w﻿ill be demolished and rebuilt for a modern building. The Preakness Stakes will relocate to Laurel Park in Maryland for the 2026 race, with the intention of the middle jewel of horse racing returning to Baltimore in 2027.
