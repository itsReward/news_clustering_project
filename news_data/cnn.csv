CNN,Business,Trump will announce a ‘major trade deal’ with the UK Thursday,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/business/trade-deal-trump,"President Donald Trump said he would make a significant trade announcement Thursday with the United Kingdom, yet another sign of some possible relief from historically high tariffs that have threatened serious damage to the US and global economies. “Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!” Trump posted Wednesday night on Truth Social. Trump said the deal with the UK would be substantial. “The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,” Trump said in a subsequent post Thursday morning. “Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!” “This should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom,” he said in a separate message. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he will make a statement about the outcome of trade talks with the United States later on Thursday. Speaking at a conference in London, he said: “Talks with the US have been ongoing and you’ll hear more from me about that later today.” Trump’s administration has previously suggested it is in active negotiations with India, the UK, South Korea and Japan. Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told CNN Tuesday that he suspected the UK may be the first country to sign a trade agreement with the United States. “I don’t know if it’s going to be the UK first or India first, it’s — we’ve got a little twist in the India story, so that might slow things down there, but I can assure the American people that there will be deals, and they will be very good deals for the American people,” Navarro said.

The Bank of England cuts interest rates as tariffs endanger global economic growth The Financial Times on Tuesday reported that a UK trade deal could be signed this week and could exempt the United States from some non-tariff trade barriers, including the UK’s 2% digital services tax charged to US technology companies. In exchange, the United States may ease the tariff burden on the UK, perhaps reducing or exempting the country from 25% tariffs on aluminum, steel and autos, the FT reported. For weeks, Trump officials have said they are talking to more than a dozen countries and are nearing a deal, but none have been announced so far. Trump has frequently said he is in no rush to sign a deal, claiming that countries have been “ripping off” America for years and the high tariffs the United States has imposed will help balance trade. Financial markets cheered the news of a deal. Dow futures rose nearly 400 points, or 0.9%. The broader S&P 500 futures were up 1.1%, and Nasdaq futures were 1.5% higher. The FTSE 100 rose 0.3% after the trade news and a rate-cut announcement from the Bank of England earlier in the day Thursday. Despite the administration’s rhetoric that it is in advanced trade negotiations with more than a dozen countries, actual trade deals take significant time, often years, to hash out. They typically involve incredibly complex agreements, delving into the minutiae of various goods and non-tariff barriers. They often involve significant political considerations, as various parties seek to protect voters with special interests. Instead, the “deal” Trump teased is more likely a memorandum of understanding. That may result in lower tariffs on one particular country’s goods in the near term, but they’ll do little that amounts to a substantial economic win for quite some time. “This is expected to be a ‘heads of terms’ agreement which sets the broad contours of the arrangement,” JPMorgan analyst Allan Monks wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “The full details are yet to be determined bilaterally and will follow further negotiations” JPMorgan said the scope of the deal appears limited, because US tariffs on the UK are expected to remain higher than they were before Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement on April 2. The economic benefit to the United Kingdom will be small, Monks said. And this is just a single agreement. Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs that went into effect April 7 and were paused for 90 days on April 9 affect dozens of countries. A hundred or so more are subject to the 10% universal tariff. The administration can’t possibly get those all done by July 8. “The 90-day tariff pause, which is now roughly 25% over, provides little time for the typical back-and-forth trade discussions that require months if not years to craft a trade deal,” said Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute. “There is a significant difference if these deals are official, written trade agreements rather than verbal commitments to buy more US products, as one has long-term economic implications and the other can be ignored down the line,” he added.

Key takeaways from the Fed’s latest decision to hold rates steady as it warns of stagflation Trump said last month he would not extend the tariffs a second time — and, in fact, may act sooner to reinstate some tariffs for countries with whom his administration cannot reach an agreement, perhaps in a matter of a couple weeks. “It will be difficult for the US trade representative to negotiate potentially 100 separate trade agreements within 90 days, meaning President Trump must soon determine whether tariffs will be reinstated or delayed further,” Jensen said. And even if deals are ultimately completed with all countries, there’s no guarantee Trump would keep them. For example, Trump, in his first term, was instrumental in negotiating the USMCA free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, only to abandon it in his second term, charging an on-again, off-again 25% tariff on some Mexican and Canadian goods. And by placing significant tariffs on virtually all goods coming into the United States, Trump also blew up a number of existing trade deals with allies. Trump’s announcement of a trade deal is the second significant sign this week that the administration may be open to negotiations that would ultimately lower some tariffs on foreign nations. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will both travel to Geneva, Switzerland, where they will meet their Chinese counterparts. Although Bessent told Fox News not to expect a major trade deal from the meetings, he acknowledged it was an important step in negotiations and could de-escalate tensions that have led the United States to place at least a 145% tariff on most Chinese goods. In turn, China has placed a 125% tariff on US goods. Trump, however, on Wednesday said he would not lower the high tariffs on China in advance of discussions, which Beijing has previously said was a pre-condition for talks. When asked in the Oval Office whether he was open to pulling back the historically high tariffs to get China to the negotiating table, Trump replied simply with: “No.” Nevertheless, any thaw in the trade war could be a welcome sign for businesses and consumers in both countries and around the globe. The punishing tariffs have already damaged economies around the world — particularly America’s. The US economy went into reverse in the first quarter, its first contraction in three years, as businesses stockpiled goods in anticipation of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which began in the second quarter.

The first boats carrying Chinese goods with 145% tariffs are arriving in LA. Shipments are cut in half. Expect shortages soon Although the China-US trade standoff is by far the most aggressive, Trump has imposed large tariffs on most other countries around the world too: a 10% universal tariff on virtually all goods entering the United States, plus 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, auto parts and some goods from Mexico and Canada. So the world will be watching Thursday’s announcement and the US-China talks this weekend with anticipation. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said at a press conference that tariffs could do serious damage to America’s economy. But he said the trade talks the United States is holding with foreign countries could prevent the worst-case scenario. Global economists at the International Monetary Fund, OECD and World Bank have all predicted that Trump’s trade war would have disastrous effects on the global economy, slowing growth dramatically in some countries, while reigniting inflation. Many US economists and large banks predict the United States could enter a recession this year. This story has been updated with additional developments and context.

CNN,Business,Will the Fed step in if America’s labor market cracks from Trump’s tariffs?,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/business/fed-labor-market-trump-tariffs,"In President Donald Trump’s volatile trade war, the Federal Reserve may face the difficult choice of saving jobs or fighting inflation. But if push comes to shove, the central bank would likely prioritize the labor market. The Fed is tasked by Congress to safeguard the job market and wrangle inflation — its so-called dual mandate — primarily using interest rates to achieve those goals. In most instances, it’s clear which side of the Fed’s dual mandate needs attention. For example, the Fed lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy in the throes of the Great Recession in 2008, when job losses were rampant. And when inflation was running at 40-year highs in 2022, the Fed aggressively raised interest rates to cool the economy and stem price pressures. Related article
The Fed faces two potential economic crises. It can prioritize just one Now, the central bank is confronting a challenge it hasn’t seen in decades: Its dual objectives are simultaneously under threat as Trump’s punishing tariffs threaten to drive both unemployment and inflation higher. The president’s tit-for-tat trade war is already weighing on American businesses and consumers. The Fed on Wednesday held rates steady for the third time in a row, waiting for Trump’s policies to show up more clearly in economic data. But the central bank’s latest policy statement noted that the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation has risen. At a news conference that same day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that stagflation — the combination of stagnant growth and higher inflation — would put the central bank in a difficult situation. But Fed officials, including Powell on Wednesday, have hinted that they’ll respond quickly to any whiff of a weakening labor market, as they did last year, even if there’s a tariff-induced rise in inflation. “When the Fed starts to see the unemployment rate rise and nonfarm payrolls start to crack, they’re going to prioritize the employment side,” Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN. Fed officials have said there’s good reason to believe any inflation induced by tariffs might be temporary. “Inflation could rise starting in a few months and then move back down toward our target possibly as early as by the end of this year. Yes, I am saying that I expect that elevated inflation would be temporary,” Christopher Waller, who is on the Fed’s Board of Governors, said on April 14 at an event in St. Louis, Missouri. But even if inflation rises only temporarily, “the effects on output and employment could be longer-lasting and an important factor in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy,” he said. But St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem warned in a speech in late March that the Fed should be “wary of assuming that the impact of tariff increases on inflation will be entirely temporary.” Related article
The Fed leaves its key interest rate as is. Here’s how you can benefit Inflation could stick around and become a bigger problem if people lose faith that price increases will go back to normal or if there are supply-chain disruptions. However, a weakening job market could very well undo upward pressure on prices. “Any sign of growing slack in the jobs market would give the Fed some reassurance that inflationary pressures will subside, and give them room to offer more support to the economy with rate cuts,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. In April, the US economy added a stronger-than-expected 177,000 jobs as the unemployment rate held steady at a low 4.2%. But hiring trends could change, as recession fears and high levels of economic uncertainty loom. “Many firms (in the Boston Fed’s district) planned to pause or limit hiring going forward because of policy uncertainty,” according to the central bank’s latest Beige Book report, a periodic collection of survey responses from businesses across the country. Trump’s tariffs have already weighed on economic growth. Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, fell in the beginning of the year in its first quarterly decline since 2022. Americans had rushed to buy products ahead of the tariffs, sending imports surging and far outpacing exports. Last year, the Fed showed it’s highly sensitive to a weakening labor market. In September, the central bank delivered a bold half-point cut after unemployment climbed for a few months and employers downshifted job growth. It turned out that the job market was just softening, but Fed officials still responded swiftly. “The Fed surprised everyone with that 50 basis-point cut,” Cervi said. “Jerome Powell, in my opinion, is a bit more dovish than not, and we think that that that will likely prevail here.” “Dovish” is a term that refers to when a Fed official is more concerned with preventing any undue damage to the economy or the labor market. Powell, in Wednesday’s news conference, defended that jumbo rate cut, saying “it was a really obvious concern” at the time. “The unemployment rate went up by almost a full percentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month, and everywhere people were talking about downside risks to the labor market,” Powell said. “We’ve been there for inflation for a couple of years and we wanted to show also that we’re there for the labor market, and it’s important that we sent that signal,” he said.",2025-05-08
CNN,Business,Joe Raedle/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/business/trump-two-dolls-tariffs-manly-nightcap,"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The president wants to make two things clear: His tariffs are the most important reordering of global trade the world has ever seen. And his tariffs are not that big of a deal, if you’re man enough. It’s just one of the many manosphere-coded talking points coming out of the White House and its right-wing media fans to defend radical tariffs that Trump claims will revive rugged, traditionally male-dominated jobs in factories. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, between rounds of congressional testimony, went on Fox News — where hosts have spun Trump’s tariffs as the “ultimate testosterone boost” — to reiterate Trump’s suddenly very pronounced opinions about the appropriate number of toys children should have. Trump probably wasn’t supposed to admit on camera that his signature economic policy would cause prices to go up. But rather than spin it, Trump and Co. have doubled down. “All I’m saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old girl, doesn’t need 37 dolls,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. Earlier, he told NBC News’ Kristen Welker: “I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable.” But the administration’s emphasis on toys for girls is no gaffe. It is an attempt at misdirection that’s squarely in line with the MAGA right’s obsession with traditional, binary gender expressions. “The reason they keep using dolls as their example is because they’re trying to frame caring about material stuff as feminine and thus inherently shameful,” wrote Leah Greenberg, co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive organizing group Indivisible, on Bluesky. By focusing on dolls and girls, Trump’s message of austerity becomes less about sacrificing for his trade war and morphs into more of a taunt: “What are you afraid of, your kid won’t have dolls to play with?” And it conveniently leaves out all the other essentials — clothes, cars, homebuilding materials, fruits and vegetables — that will become scarcer or more expensive on his watch.

The White House billionaires have no idea how Americans live (and don’t seem to care) On Fox Tuesday, Bessent took the point further. To any kids who are sad about getting fewer dolls, Bessent would say: “You will have a better life than your parents” and “your family will own a home” because of the “economic freedom” Trump is creating. Ah, yes, the freedom to work in a factory, despite most Americans saying they do not want to work in a factory. Even some Republican lawmakers are getting annoyed with all the doll discourse. According to The Hill, GOP members of Congress who have been largely in lockstep with Trump are grumbling behind closed doors that the message of sacrifice comes off as out of touch. It shouldn’t be hard to see why the “two dolls” line is falling flat, coming from some of the wealthiest officials in American in history. Bessent is a Yale grad who amassed his multimillion-dollar fortune on Wall Street. And Trump is a crypto-peddling hotel-and-casino mogul who’s planning to spend untold amounts of taxpayer money on a military parade for his birthday next month. Is that something a 78-year-old man needs?",2025-05-08
CNN,Business,Craig Hudson/The Washington Post/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/business/washington-homes-for-sale-doge-layoffs,"The number of Washington, DC area homeowners who decided to list their homes for sale jumped last month amid steep cuts to the federal workforce. In the four weeks ending April 27, the number of active home listings in the nation’s capital surged 25.1% year-over-year, the largest gain on record, according to a new report from real estate website Redfin. The jump in DC homes for sale outpaced active listings nationwide, which grew 14.2% in that same period, Redfin said. Active listings in DC are now at their highest level since 2022, according to the report. The uptick in new homes for sale in DC comes amid steep layoffs in the federal workforce, driven by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has slashed federal funding and jobs in an attempt to reduce government spending. Redfin found that active listings are rising fastest in the suburbs of DC, where many federal workers live. Homes for sale in Alexandria, Virginia, jumped nearly 41% year-over-year during the four weeks ending April 27, the largest increase of the surrounding counties Redfin analyzed. Montgomery County, Maryland, saw new home listings surge 38.5%, and Loudoun County, Virginia, also saw a surge of 36.8%. Real estate agents in the DC area told CNN the housing market is still relatively tight, though, despite the high number of recent home listings. “While there are notable government layoffs contributing to some new listings, we’re not witnessing a mass exodus,” Candyce Astroth, a Realtor based in Fairfax, Virginia said. “The housing crisis persists, and we still need more listings to meet the demand in the market.” However, Brian Coester, a Realtor based in Maryland, said that the DC area feels “different than it’s been in a long time in the sense of the uncertainty around some of the administration changes.” According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government shed 9,000 jobs in April and has lost 26,000 workers since January. However, the true number is likely much larger. For example, workers who accepted DOGE’s offer of a “buyout” in January will not show up in federal unemployment data because they are technically still on the federal government’s payroll through September. According to a CNN analysis of official statements and internal memos, at least 121,000 federal workers were laid off or targeted for layoffs in President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office. Federal workers make up the highest proportion of the workforce in DC compared to any US state, with federal jobs constituting more than 13% of total employment, according to a March report from the Economic Policy Institute. Maryland and Virginia, states that surround DC, have the second- and third-highest shares, at 7.3% and 5.6%, respectively.",2025-05-08
CNN,Business,Fly View Productions/E+/Getty Images/File,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/business/your-savings-fed-rate-decision,"The Trump administration’s tariffs regime has disrupted markets, darkened the outlook for employers and businesses and hammered consumer sentiment. That’s why it’s more important than ever to take control of what you can financially. That can start with making sure your savings are earning the best returns possible and are parked in the right types of accounts, given your needs and time horizon. Related article
The Fed holds interest rates steady again as the US economy slows on Trump’s tariffs Since the Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided not to lower its key overnight lending rate, which affects interest rates throughout the economy, you can still earn a very healthy yield on your cash. That’s good news since economists believe inflation — which came in at 2.3% in March – will be going up this year as a result of the tariffs. By how much? Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN’s Alicia Wallace he expects both headline and core inflation to top 4% later this year. So you’ll want to look for returns on your cash that can match or beat that expectation. For money you’re setting aside for emergencies or for near-term but not immediate cash-flow needs, consider using: FDIC-insured online high-yield savings accounts: Having a checking and savings account at one of the big brick-and-mortar banks is great for money needed to pay monthly bills, groceries and other everyday expenses. But for other money you want at the ready for less regular expenses, you’ll get a much better rate in a high-yield savings account at an online FDIC-insured bank. All bank savings rates are variable — so will fall if the Fed lowers its benchmark rate later this year. But, for now, many of the highest-yielding online savings accounts are paying between 4% and 4.4%, versus roughly 0.1% at the biggest banks like Chase, according to Bankrate.com. FDIC-insured online money market accounts: Another online banking option that pays very competitively are money market accounts. “The average MMA yield at brick-and-mortar banks is a scant 0.41%, whereas the top-yielding, nationally available MMAs offered by online banks pay 10 times that amount, 4.1% or more. Ten times the return, while still being fully covered by federal deposit insurance and (offering you) access to the money when it is needed,” said Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst. For money you’ve set aside for down-the-line expenses like a down payment or a year or more of living expenses if you’re retiring soon, you can lock in advantageous rates now through: Treasuries: Treasury bills come in six different maturities, ranging from four to 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven and 10 years. If you buy one and hold it to maturity, you will lock in a rate of return that is higher than inflation while also preserving your principal. If you want to know how much you’ll make by holding it to maturity, “It’s hard to beat,” said Ken Robinson, an Ohio-based certified financial planner who is part of Wealthramp, a network of experienced, fee-only advisers. As of Tuesday evening on Schwab.com, Treasury bills were offering average yields ranging from a low of 3.88% to a high of 4.33%, while Treasury note yields ranged from 3.78% to 4.28%. Interest paid on Treasuries is exempt from state and local income taxes, so may be a good option if you live in a high-tax area. Know, though, that if you sell a Treasury before it matures, that can trigger a capital gain or loss on the price you get for it. Related article
Municipal bond yields offer attractive returns for individual investors. Could Congress kill their tax advantage? AAA-rated municipal bonds: The tax advantages of high-quality municipal bonds are particularly favorable for those in high-tax states, and especially people in the top income tax brackets. The interest you earn on munis, which are issued by state and local governments, is exempt from federal income tax. It also may be exempt from state and local taxes if you buy one issued by your home state. “(Highly rated muni bonds) have a supremely strong record of paying what they’re supposed to when they’re supposed to,” Robinson said. As with Treasuries, he noted, the key to getting the most out of a municipal bond is to hold it to maturity. Certificates of deposit: CDs from FDIC-insured banks are a reliable place to park money that you can afford to lock up for a fixed period. For instance, CDs with maturation periods ranging from 3 months to five years were all offering average yields over 4% on Schwab.com. A good number of individual one-year CDs were offering a return between 4.5% and 5%. Keep in mind, earnings on a CD are subject to federal, state and local income taxes. In addition, if you buy a CD direct from a bank, you may pay an early withdrawal penalty if you cash it out before maturity, although such a penalty will be tax deductible. If you buy a so-called “brokered” CD on a brokerage platform — which offers you a much wider range of CDs to choose from — you might lose money on your principal if you don’t hold it to maturity and instead sell it into the secondary market at less than you bought it for, Robinson noted. Money market mutual funds: Money market mutual funds are currently averaging 4.14%, according to Crane Data, with some funds paying close to 4.4%. Unlike with fixed-rate bonds, Treasuries or CDs, you can’t lock in a rate of return with a money market fund. But it’s an easy, one-stop shop to park money that will always get the best cash yields on offer. Money market funds, which invest in government and corporate debt securities, are considered low-risk investments that usually maintain a price of $1 a share, although there have been a few times when they “broke the buck” and traded below $1 a share. If the fund invests in top-rated municipal securities issued by your home state, your returns may be tax-free. Unlike money market accounts, money market mutual funds are not federally insured. There is nothing encouraging to say about interest rates on debt other than at least the Fed didn’t choose to raise rates, which would make your prospects for finding an affordable loan worse. That said, how you manage your debt is ultimately way more important than any move the Fed makes. Credit cards: Even if the Fed were to make dramatic rate cuts, the interest you pay to borrow money on a credit card likely will remain sky-high. In fact, the average credit card rate actually rose to 20.12% as of April 30 from 20.09% the week before, according to Bankrate.com. The best thing you can do if you carry high-rate credit card debt is to see if you can get a 0% balance transfer card, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. That will buy you up to 21 months interest free, during which time you can direct as much money as you can to paying down your balance. Mortgages: As of May 1, interest rates on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.76%, according to Freddie Mac. That’s 0.05 points lower than the prior week, and just under half a point below the 7.22% average recorded around May 1 last year. “For those shopping for a home this summer, rates are likely to stay in or around (the 6.6% to 7%) range in the near future. Even a rate cut from the Fed may not send mortgage rates lower, as the Fed doesn’t impact mortgage rates directly the way they do with credit cards,” Schulz said. Car loans: Financing a car purchase is always a little complex. But the math is harder now. “Today’s car shoppers are contending with the difficult duo of elevated vehicle costs and high borrowing rates,” said Joseph Yoon, a consumer insights analyst at Edmunds.com. “Adding to this scenario is the ambiguity surrounding tariff repercussions on vehicle supply and, consequently, their price tags, forcing buyers to navigate an ever-more complicated shopping path.” In April the average amount financed for a new car rose  about $400 to $41,444 at 7.1% interest over 69 months, with an average monthly payment of $744, according to data from Edmunds.com. For used cars, the average loan amount was up about $600 to $28,855 at 10.9% over 69.5 months, with an average monthly payment of $555. Yoon’s advice: Be really clear what your needs are for a new car versus your wants — including things like size and desired features. Then shop around for the best deals and carefully compare loan offers. To help with the math, Edmunds.com has a car loan interest calculator.",2025-05-08
CNN,Politics,Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/politics/fired-federal-workers-trump-jobs,"After firing tens of thousands of federal workers this year, President Donald Trump has also made it much harder for them to get their jobs back as he imposes his will over the labor agencies that are supposed to protect their rights. He has hobbled independent labor boards, installed a loyalist at a key agency that protects civil servants, and signed an executive order to end collective bargaining for many federal workers. This has left government employees with dwindling options to contest their firings through channels normally available to civil servants, with many turning to the courts for relief or giving up altogether. “It is significantly more difficult for a federal employee to have their case heard by an independent body,” said former Merit Systems Protection Board member Ray Limon. “What we’re seeing here is a complete elimination of traditional employee due process and investigation of complaints, which is unparalleled in the history of our government.” Related article
Analyzing the scale of Trump’s federal layoffs in his first 100 days In an effort to ensure a stable, professional and merit-based workforce across administrations, Congress has long mandated certain due-process protections from arbitrary firings for the more than 2 million federal employees. But as federal employees – ranging from newer “probationary” workers who were fired en masse, to career civil servants who believe they were dismissed  for partisan purposes – seek to challenge their terminations in the second Trump administration, they are finding it harder than ever to push back. Amid sweeping layoffs and resignations, civic groups have stepped in to connect some of these disillusioned workers with new jobs in state and local government. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is fighting in court to defend his mass firings and executive orders. “President Trump is the chief executive of the executive branch and reserves the right to fire anyone he wants,” White House press secretary  Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. The reversal of fortunes for fired employees has been most glaring at the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which was created by Congress in the post-Watergate era to safeguard merit systems in the federal government. The agency often advocates on behalf of employees at the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which reviews workers’ complaints. Hampton Dellinger was one year into his five-year term at OSC when Trump was sworn in. It didn’t take long for the Senate-confirmed Biden appointee to break ranks with Trump on a major priority for the new administration: shrinking the size of the federal workforce. Dellinger concluded that Trump’s mass firings of probationary workers were unlawful, and successfully urged the MSPB to reinstate 6,000 employees. Advocacy groups hailed the outcome as a landmark moment that could pave the way for additional reinstatements. Then, Trump fired Dellinger. After Dellinger lost a brief court battle over his own termination, Trump turned to two loyalists to fill his role. He tapped Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins in February to temporarily lead OSC, and by late March, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer was slotted into the acting role. Under Greer’s watch, OSC dropped its support for reinstating any probationary employees. OSC notified some federal employees in late April that it conducted a “review” and determined that the firings were proper and were “in accordance with the new administration’s priorities,” according to legal filings and records reviewed by CNN. This was a 180-degree turn from OSC’s position under Dellinger. “We’re now seeing OSC not actually do the kinds of things it’s supposed to be doing,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which represented the 6,000 reinstated workers. “The administration… is seeking to undermine accountability structures that were put in place to ensure federal employees have redress and civil service protections.” An OSC spokesman declined to comment. The Trump administration has also defanged, at least for the time being, two federal labor boards – which serve as bulwarks against partisan abuses and workplace discrimination by independently reviewing complaints. MSPB and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) are currently without a quorum after Trump fired several members, leaving them operational but unable to function at full strength.  The people Trump fired were appointed by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate. For instance, the MSPB can’t issue final rulings on workers’ complaints without a quorum. And the EEOC isn’t able to initiate major litigation or vote on policy rulemaking. One MSPB member that Trump fired has filed a lawsuit to get her job back, which would restore a quorum. But she faces an uphill fight at the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, which has already rebuffed her bid to get back on the job while her legal case plays out. MSPB spokesman Zachary Kurz said the agency “remains open for business and its work continues,” adding that its “ability to adjudicate cases is fully functional across its regional offices, and it will continue to process petitions for review.” EEOC spokesman James Ryan said the commission “is still open for business and taking all charges.” In December, during the presidential transition, the EEOC voted on a bipartisan basis to delegate some of its powers to commission staff, which they could use if a quorum is lost. There are signs that the Trump administration may be slow-walking some MSPB cases. Typically, the agency facing a worker’s complaint will defend itself at MSPB. But the lead HR agency overseeing federal civil servants, the Office of Personnel Management, is intervening in more than 40 pending cases involving Justice Department officials that were fired in March, according to filings reviewed by CNN. OPM has asked an administrative judge to pause all of the 40-plus cases, according to the filings. CNN has reached out to OPM for comment about its intervention in these MSPB cases. Limon, the former Democratic-appointed MSPB member, said it is “very unusual” for OPM to intervene in pending cases like these. It never happened during his three years as vice chairman, he said, but it could be warranted if there is an apparent conflict of interest. One of the cases was filed by Liz Oyer, the former Justice Department pardon attorney who was part of a large group of firings approved by Todd Blanche, the former Trump lawyer who is now deputy attorney general. Oyer claims she was terminated because she refused to bow to pressure from Trump appointees who wanted her to restore the gun rights of actor Mel Gibson, which he lost after a 2011 state domestic violence conviction. “It does not seem like the MSPB proceeding will be resolved anytime soon,” Oyer told CNN. “The Justice Department is doing everything they can to delay and avoid providing any information about the reasons for my firing and others. This is frustrating and unfortunate for everyone who lost their jobs and who have no other recourse.” Blanche previously told CNN in a statement that Oyer’s “version of events is false” and “erroneous.” CNN has reported that some fired workers are struggling to navigate overlapping agencies that handle complaints and to decipher the “legalese” on government websites. Union stewards often help members through this process but those efforts have been undermined by Trump’s recent executive order attempting to end collective bargaining rights for a large share of the federal workforce. Alex Berman, an Internal Revenue Service employee who is a union leader in Philadelphia, said some of his colleagues aren’t sure if they are even allowed to talk to their union representatives after Trump’s executive order. And in some IRS offices, he said union leaders have been banned from using official time to answer questions from union members, as was permitted under their existing contract when Trump took office. The IRS didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment. ‘Most employees know what they’re supposed to do for their jobs, but don’t know what recourse there may be in any given situation, up to and including a firing,” Berman said. “Without the unions, people are in the dark as to what their rights and responsibilities are.” His group, the National Treasury Employees Union, has repeatedly sued the Trump administration and convinced a judge to block his collective-bargaining ban. It’s one of more than a dozen labor unions, anti-Trump groups, and advocacy organizations that launched a legal defense fund to help people “who have been fired illegally” under Trump. Some terminated employees – like the probationary hires, and the former top OSC and MSPB officials – saw initial success in court, where judges ruled that their firings were unlawful. But the Trump administration has prevailed in reversing some of those decisions, some on a temporary basis, as they are heard by more conservative federal appellate courts. “The courts will be increasingly important as the administration seeks to close other avenues for redress,” said Perryman, whose group is involved in the legal defense fund. She said more than 1,000 lawyers signed up in the first week to volunteer their time. As morale falls with each round of mass firings, some groups see an opportunity. Caitlin Lewis, the executive director at Work For America, launched a service that is trying to match up thousands of federal employees with jobs in state or local government. “Oversight authorities and regulatory authorities are being stripped of their powers,” Lewis said. “The overwhelming sentiment is exhaustion and frustration. They don’t feel equipped to take on the system as individuals. As they’ve been left in this state of purgatory and confusion, their faith is diminishing that the system is going to protect their legal rights.” Her CivicMatch platform has seen a 15-fold increase in activity since Trump took office, with more than 8,000 federal workers expressing interest in new public sector jobs. Many worked at hard-hit agencies like the IRS and the US Agency for International Development. While some workers are mobile, plenty of others are unable to uproot their families in search of new opportunities, especially in an uncertain economic climate. For those who are willing to make the move, however, some states and cities recently stepped up recruitment efforts, to fill their own ranks with veterans of the public service sector – and to stand up to Trump. “More and more people are unwilling to wait it out,” Lewis said. “It’s a moment of loss for the federal government, but it’s a moment of possibility for state and local governments.”",2025-05-08
CNN,Politics,Upcoming changes at CIA shine a spotlight on the spy agency’s director John Ratcliffe,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/politics/cia-director-ratcliffe-spotlight-reorganization,"As one of the last federal agencies to face major changes in President Donald Trump’s norm-bending second term, the CIA is bracing for significant cuts and a reorganization that seeks to elevate covert operations by hiring more officers to go in the field and fewer analysts to sit behind computer screens. The coming changes have sharpened the focus on CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who so far has walked a fine line between maintaining favor with the White House and building trust with career rank-and-file officers at the storied spy agency that Trump views as a key part of the so-called “Deep State.” Up to now, Ratcliffe appears to have insulated the CIA from the kind of political meddling by the White House that many career officials have feared would come with a second Trump administration. Ratcliffe and his deputy Michael Ellis “may have come to the conclusion that these people are professionals, there really is no deep state out here,” said one former senior intelligence official. “But now you are pushing against the White House that believes there is.” Several intelligence officials said Ratcliffe seems to spend most of his time across the river at the White House – leaving some in the workforce with the impression he is very “hands-off,” one US official said. Others said it’s not clear to the rank-and-file who is really running the agency, with another former official describing the CIA as “rudderless” – deepening concerns among some career professionals that the uncertainty will lead to a brain drain as talented officers retire or take Trump’s buyout offer. Overall, the sentiment toward Ratcliffe among career officials within CIA headquarters at Langley is lukewarm, multiple current and former US officials told CNN, with one official describing him as “the least bad option” to serve as Trump’s CIA director. “Being at the White House all the time is a good thing,” a person close to Trump told CNN. “It would be far more concerning if Ratcliffe was never meeting with the president. It shows he still values him.” So far, Ratcliffe has not made the kind of broad cuts that the administration has demanded of other agencies, despite a clear desire by Trump and his allies to reshape the spy agency. Ratcliffe’s relationship with the White House has allowed him the latitude to manage the agency on his own timeline, sources close to the president say. Some career officials see Ratcliffe as quietly acting as a kind of buffer between the White House and the agency. “As he has learned more about our people and capabilities I think he is wanting to support us, but most of his time is spent downtown and Cabinet focused,” said another US official, adding that “running the organization is really falling more on” Ratcliffe’s deputy, Ellis. “Director Ratcliffe has made it clear that CIA will pursue President Trump’s national security priorities with laser-like focus,” CIA spokesperson Liz Lyons said in a statement to CNN. “The Agency is determined to provide the President with an unparalleled advantage and, under Director Ratcliffe, it is aggressively doing just that. Any insinuation to the contrary is false and completely baseless.” Ratcliffe, a former Republican Texas congressman, has taken a deliberately under-the-radar approach during his first few months on the job, meeting with Trump behind closed doors at the White House and making selective media appearances. He has also played a key role in helping the administration navigate some of its most pressing foreign policy challenges. In April, Trump sent Ratcliffe to Israel for high-level discussions about the administration’s ongoing pursuit of a deal with Iran to surrender its entire nuclear program, according to two sources familiar with the trip. Earlier in Trump’s second term, Ratcliffe also quietly helped to secure the release of multiple Americans held in Russia. But, unlike special envoy Steve Witkoff who was credited for the release, Ratcliffe’s involvement in those talks was not widely publicized. Ratcliffe’s approach to his job stands in stark contrast to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has issued agency-wide directives via social media posts on X and in public pronouncements on Fox News – a difference in style that has not gone unnoticed by career intelligence officials. Ratcliffe has also not made the kind of high-profile blunders that led to the dismissal of former national security advisor Mike Waltz, who added a journalist to a sensitive Signal chat about war planning, and additional scrutiny of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose classified texts to the chat churned headlines for days. However, Ratcliffe’s presence and contribution to the now-infamous unsecure chat did raise eyebrows inside the CIA for its sensitive nature. Intelligence sources said there was anger and disbelief that there had been such carelessness using Signal instead of secure communications. Officials were also concerned that sources and methods were revealed. “It was obvious it was either a human source or drones. Either way, not OK,” said a former high-ranking intelligence official. There are signs that Ratcliffe is walking a fine line: Trump has on at least one occasion expressed frustration that Ratcliffe is not moving faster to fire workers, reorganize the agency, and undo changes made under President Barack Obama, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trump did have some initial skepticism about Ratcliffe before his inauguration, another source familiar with the dynamic acknowledged. However, this person said that, as far as they know, the president has not said anything negative about his CIA director since entering the White House for his second term. Ratcliffe has taken some visible steps toward implementing Trump’s vision. He has fired some probationary employees and other officers involved in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; he has also dismissed a senior official who had been targeted by a far-right activist. Many of those officials have challenged their firings in court and legal proceedings are ongoing. Related article
Officials say texts sent by Waltz, Ratcliffe in Signal chat may have damaged US’ ongoing ability to gather intel on Houthis In March, Ratcliffe also welcomed Elon Musk to the agency’s headquarters for a briefing and publicly commemorated the visit with a photo of the two men standing next to the famous CIA seal. “He fired all the DEI employees even though they sued. He offered the ‘fork in the road’ DOGE email, even though CIA had been exempt, then went over and above and offered early retirement. Then he proactively invited Elon out to the agency and talked to him about DOGE ideas he had,” a person who works closely with Ratcliffe said, emphasizing Ratcliffe’s attempts to please Trump. And Ratcliffe has allies in the White House: Two sources familiar with the dynamic said Ratcliffe has become “tight” with Vice President JD Vance. Ratcliffe’s relationship with Vance dates back to before Trump’s inauguration in January, one of the sources said, noting the two men had several conversations about reforming the CIA prior to assuming their current roles in the president’s second administration. That balancing act has made it hard for rank-and-file CIA officers – many of whom are anxious about their careers – to judge how much to trust the new director, who multiple sources said has kept the flow of information inside the agency restricted to an extremely tight inner circle. In one instance, career officials were pleased to hear that a 35-year veteran of the agency was a top candidate to head the CIA’s operational wing – only to be disappointed when he was not given the role. Within the building, the episode left the impression that the candidate, Ralph Goff, who has been outspoken in support of Ukraine, was insufficiently supportive of the president and his views on the conflict there. The episode is an example that “the whole building is on tenterhooks because they don’t have any idea what is going to happen next,” said the former high-ranking intelligence official. Ratcliffe is still expected to make widespread cuts at the CIA that officials said appear tailored to elevate the role of covert operations and human intelligence gathering. Ratcliffe, Ellis and other top officials are also holding meetings on a proposed reorganization of the agency that would combine existing offices under a new “Americas” Mission Center to prioritize counternarcotics and counter-cartel work – previously a relatively small part of the agency’s mission but a top priority under Trump. The CIA under Trump has been flying unarmed surveillance drone missions over Mexican airspace and reviewing its legal authorities to conduct lethal action against cartels – a frequent topic of conversation at the White House, according to a source familiar with the matter. Ratcliffe has made clear that one of his top priorities as CIA director is refocusing the agency on covert action and collecting human intelligence. “We will collect intelligence – especially human intelligence – in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult. We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgement or infect our products,” Ratcliffe told Senate lawmakers during his confirmation hearing earlier this year.

CIA flying covert drone missions into Mexico to spy on drug cartels “We will conduct covert action at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do,” he said. Ratcliffe’s plans also include shrinking the agency’s workforce by about 1,200 personnel over the next several years through a combination of early retirement, deferred resignations, and reduced hiring, according to a source familiar with the matter. In total, the planned cuts will affect between 5-6% of the CIA’s total workforce, the source added. But the changes are unlikely to impact hiring at CIA’s Directorate of Operations, according to the source familiar with the matter. Instead, the effort appears likely to include cutting some positions currently held by analysts at the agency, suggesting a clear prioritization of officials who operate in the field over those who work to make sense of multiple streams of intelligence, according to current and former US officials. That goal aligns with the vision outlined for the CIA in a Trump transition planning document obtained by CNN, which details how the new administration should limit analysts’ ability to influence decisions related to covert operations and reassert control over those programs to ensure they are aligned with the president’s policy goals. The agency is reevaluating what were known as the “Brennan reforms” – named for former CIA Director John Brennan – which integrated analysts with the agency’s operations officers. Critics of the move have long argued that having the two roles work together compromised hard-nosed analysis. Some covert officers have also long contended that the move weakened the agency’s elite spies, elevating analysts at their expense. Under Trump, those voices appear to have gained an audience.

CNN,Politics,Chief Justice John Roberts stresses judicial independence amid tensions with Trump,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/john-roberts-event-judicial-independence,"Chief Justice John Roberts stressed the importance of judicial independence during public remarks Wednesday, noting that the judiciary’s role as a co-equal branch of government is central to the nation’s political system. “The judiciary is a coequal branch of government, separate from the others with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law, and strike down, obviously, acts of Congress or acts of the president,” Roberts said at an event in his native Buffalo, New York. The judiciary’s role, Roberts added, is to “decide cases but, in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or the executive.” That work, Roberts said, “does require a degree of independence.” Roberts’ remarks on the judiciary drew an extended round of applause from the judges and lawyers who gathered in Western New York to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the federal court there. The chief justice was born in Buffalo but moved to Indiana when he was 10 years old. Roberts, who in September will mark his 20th year as chief, did not mention President Donald Trump by name, nor did he directly discuss the tension between the executive and judicial branches that has surfaced since the president took office in January. Asked about calls by Trump and some of his allies to impeach judges who rule against his administration, Roberts noted that he had issued a statement on that issue earlier this year. “Impeachment is not how you register disagreement with decisions,” he said. Related article
John Roberts has enabled Trump. Now he hopes to restrain him Roberts delivered a rare rebuke to the president in March, issuing the statement in response to calls at the time to impeach judges who have placed some parts of his agenda on hold, including the administration’s rapid rewriting of federal immigration policies and its efforts to reduce government spending approved by Congress. “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said in his earlier statement. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.” In recent public remarks, Trump has been more careful to specifically vow to honor future Supreme Court rulings – even as he has continued to rail against judges who rule against him. But in a number of high-profile cases, including one involving a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, the administration has interpreted any ambiguity to its advantage. Roberts, who has frequently raised the importance of judicial independence in the past, made no mention of the large number of cases involving Trump’s second term that have landed on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket in recent months, including appeals involving the firing of board members at independent agencies and the controversial effort to deport some migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. One of the highest profile cases now pending at the court involves Trump’s order to effectively end birthright citizenship. After lower courts blocked the administration from moving forward, the administration has asked the justices to significantly limit who would be protected by those lower court orders. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in that case on May 15. Most of Roberts’ remarks Wednesday stuck to familiar themes, though the chief justice did briefly defend decisions that overturn precedent. Though Roberts did not discuss specific modern cases, his court has received significant blowback – and sagging public approval – for its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. “A lot of people talk as if we’re overruling a lot more. It’s the lowest it’s been since the ’50s,” Roberts said. And some cases, Roberts said, should be overruled. “The idea that its invariably a bad thing to overrule precedent is, I think, quite mistaken,” he added. “At the same time, you can’t do it willy nilly.” Asked by US District Judge Lawrence Vilardo if he ever thought about retiring, Roberts shot back flatly: “No.” The chief justice, who turned 70 this year, then launched into a discussion about how he might make that calculation some day. If he recognized, at some point, that he was a burden to the court, he said, maybe that would be different. Roberts said he once asked “very good friends” to let him know if they ever felt it was time for him to step down. After a long pause, Roberts said, both friends simultaneously joked that it was already time. For now, Roberts said, he felt “pretty healthy.” “I’m going out feet first,” he said.

CNN,Politics,Federal judge probing whether Trump has the power to bring back migrants deported to El Salvador,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/federal-judge-probing-trump-power-el-salvador,"A federal judge pressed the Justice Department on President Donald Trump’s suggestion that he could secure the return of migrants deported to a Salvadoran super prison, during a Wednesday evening hearing where the judge approved more fact-finding into whether the US has custody over the migrants it sent to the prison. US District Judge James Boasberg is considering a dispute stemming from Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, but he brought up the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia – who was wrongly deported to El Salvador under a different immigration authority and whose case is in front of a different judge – as he weighs a request from the migrants before him that they be returned to the US so they can have the opportunity to challenge Trump’s use of the sweeping wartime authority against them. “Didn’t the president say just last week that he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia just by picking up the phone and asking El Slavador to release him – so is the president telling the truth?” Boasberg asked an attorney for the Justice Department. DOJ attorney Abhishek Kambli did not answer the question directly, prompting frustration from Boasberg. He instead claimed that Trump’s comments spoke to “the president’s belief of the influence he has.” The belief doesn’t negate the idea that El Salvador ultimately has control, Kambli argued. Before Boasberg decides whether the migrants in his case should be returned, he first must decide if the US even has custody of them now that they’re in the Salvadoran prison. “I think plaintiffs may well have sufficiently made out a case for constructive custody,” he said at one point during the hearing Wednesday afternoon but added that he wanted more information to help him make a decision on the question. Boasberg is first requesting that the Trump administration put forward any declarations or documents by Friday that would back up its claims that the US government does not have custody of the migrants. Lawyers for the migrants will then be able to request any additional discovery – though the judge said he would only allow for a very “cabined” inquiry – that would help him make his decision. He said he would issue an order on Thursday that will give more detail about how the process will move forward.",2025-05-08
CNN,Politics,Exclusive: Some ‘Les Mis’ cast members plan to boycott Trump’s attendance at Kennedy Center performance next month,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/kennedy-center-les-mis-cast-boycott-trump,"When President Donald Trump descends on the Kennedy Performing Arts Center next month for a high-dollar fundraiser and a performance of “Les Misérables,” he won’t be seeing the usual cast performing, sources told CNN. At least 10 to 12 performers in Les Mis are planning to sit out the show on June 11, the night that Trump attends at the Kennedy Center, the sources said. The cast was given the option to not perform the night Trump will be in the audience, and both major cast members and members of the ensemble are among those sitting out, according to the sources. The move highlights friction between the Trump administration and members within the center as the president has made an aggressive push to reshape it, thrusting the Washington, DC-based performing arts complex into the middle of culture wars. The boycott follows Trump’s decision to effectively take control of the Kennedy Center as part of a widespread effort his administration has undertaken to bend American institutions – including cultural, legal and educational pillars – to the president’s will. Less than a month into his presidency, Trump installed himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center thanks to a newly constituted board, including several new Trump appointees who replaced trustees appointed by Democratic presidents. He also named Richard Grenell, a longtime confidant already serving in multiple administration positions, to the director role earlier this year. The same night that Trump will attend the performance of Les Mis, he will also hold a fundraiser to benefit the Kennedy Center. The fundraiser was first reported by ABC News. “We are definitely using the Les Mis opening as an opportunity” to shore up the center’s finances, one person familiar with the plans told CNN. During his 2016 campaign, Trump used music from Les Mis during his campaign rallies, which the co-creators of the musical objected to, according to the Guardian. In a statement to CNN, Grennell, who identified himself as president of the Kennedy Center, said he was unaware that some cast members planned to boycott the performance on the night of Trump’s appearance and that the Kennedy Center will “no longer fund intolerance.” “Any performer who isn’t professional enough to perform for patrons of all backgrounds, regardless of political affiliation, won’t be welcomed,” said Grennell. “In fact, we think it would be important to out those vapid and intolerant artists to ensure producers know who they shouldn’t hire - and that the public knows which shows have political litmus tests to sit in the audience. The Kennedy Center wants to be a place where people of all political stripes sit next to each other and never ask who someone voted for but instead enjoys a performance together.” CNN reached out for comment to the Kennedy Center, the company producing Les Mis and the union that represents the cast members. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has both publicly and privately complained about the state of the Kennedy Center, while Grenell previously asserted that it has “no cash on hand, no reserves.” “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA — ONLY THE BEST,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in February. “RIC, WELCOME TO SHOW BUSINESS!” Artists including Issa Rae, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds have resigned from their leadership roles or canceled events at the space in response to the changes, while the center has canceled performances, including the tour of the children’s musical “Finn.” A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center told CNN, “‘Finn’, which was not yet announced, was canceled for financial reasons PRIOR to the change in Kennedy Center leadership. The authors were also notified prior to the change.” “Finn” was commissioned by the Kennedy Center in 2023. In February, one of the show’s co-creators, Michael Kooman, told the Washington Post that before the board met to change the Kennedy Center’s leadership, the “Finn” creative team received a phone call from the center telling it the tour was canceled because “the financials weren’t working out,” Kooman said. “It’s hard to ignore the circumstances in which the cancellation of the tour is happening,” he added. High-profile shows like “Hamilton,” meanwhile, scrapped planned performances at the Kennedy Center after Trump’s takeover. During a visit to the center in March, Trump criticized Hamilton, the hit musical written by Lin-Manuel Miranda that is a modern telling of the country’s founding through the eyes of Alexander Hamilton, including a multi-ethnic cast. “I never liked Hamilton very much,” Trump told reporters. “But we are going to have some really good shows,” Trump added. “I would say this, come here and watch it, and you’ll see, over a period of time, it’ll improve very greatly physically. And we’re going to get some very good shows. The thing that does well are Broadway hits.” This story has been updated with new information.",2025-05-08
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Frazer Harrison/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-civil-cases,"By end of the week, a jury is expected to be seated in the federal sex trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs. It’s a stunning turn of events for the once kingmaker in music, a man who reached billionaire status as a rapper, producer and entrepreneur. Combs has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Regardless of the outcome, Combs’ legal troubles won’t end with his criminal trial. He’s facing more than 60 civil lawsuits in which he is accused of sexual assault or other wrongdoing. Combs has denied all the allegations. Attorney Andrew Van Arsdale, who represents 37 individuals who have already filed civil claims of sexual assault against Combs, told CNN in an exclusive interview that he has more than 400 new potential civil claims. The attorney said he intends to file civil claims against Combs after his criminal trial, largely because his clients are fearful of possible retaliation if the embattled music industry vet walks free. “From my clients’ perspective, the reason that they were so hesitant to come forward for so long in many cases was because of the power that this individual wielded and the threats to their professional opportunities that they felt he could create,” Van Arsdale said. “I do think there’s an idea that, ‘Oh my gosh, what if, what if he isn’t found guilty of these charges, right? What if he’s back on the streets in two months? What would have happened to me if I had made these allegations?” “I hear about it every day,” he added. “Our clients are still scared.” Van Arsdale operates a call center through his company, Reciprocity Industries, which is based in Billings, Montana. The company was established in 2008, long before allegations began mounting against Combs. For years, the center has helped sift through callers’ grievances across legal issues ranging from natural disaster recovery to sexual assault claims, assisting law firms with processing complaints for litigation and by marketing the hotline as an avenue through which firms can obtain potential clients. According to the company’s website, Reciprocity employs more than 150 legal intake professionals and the company’s services have been retained by over 500 law firms in the United States. Van Arsdale has litigated claims of sexual abuse against the Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic church. His law firm, AVA Law Group, represents dozens of alleged victims of Combs who were discovered through his Reciprocity call center, which the New York Times recently reported was the “central collection point” for sexual assault allegations against Combs. Records of incoming calls show Reciprocity Industries has received nearly 27,000 calls related to Combs, Van Arsdale said. After dismissing prank calls and unrelated or unreliable inquiries, his company estimates roughly 15,000 calls included claims of mistreatment by Combs. Through what he described as a rigorous vetting process, Van Arsdale said he believes there are more than 400 new, potential civil cases. At a press conference in October, his call center’s 1-800 number was emblazoned behind Van Arsdale and his co-counsel, Houston-based attorney Tony Buzbee, who has become a primary target of Combs’ defense. Combs’ lawyers have called attorneys like Van Arsdale “ambulance chasers.” Van Arsdale defends his company’s 1-800 advertising as a means for alleged victims to access the justice system. “Yes, we need a big system in order to handle the influx of phone calls, and yes, we need very serious vetting in order to make sure we’re bringing the claims that need to be handled in the civil court of law forward, but that is what this process is,” Van Arsdale said. “And they can no longer hide behind the victim shaming, even though they continue to try to do that.” CNN has reached out to Combs’ team for comment regarding Van Arsdale’s claim that he is working on hundreds of additional potential civil suits. Previously, Combs’ lawyers told CNN that he has “never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor.” “No number of lawsuits, sensationalized allegations, or media theatrics will change that reality,” they added in a statement at the time. It’s not just Van Arsdale who is going up against Combs. At least a dozen attorneys are representing plaintiffs who have filed civil claims against Combs. The majority of the accusers’ claims are unrelated, spanning across decades with alleged incidents occurring at various locations across different states. Out of the 60-plus civil cases already filed against Combs, two have been withdrawn – one, filed by an anonymous Jane Doe who declined a court order to reveal her identity, and another against Combs and Jay-Z, which was voluntarily withdrawn by the Jane Doe after Jay-Z adamantly denied her claims and a number of inconsistencies surfaced with her account. Combs’ team has seized on inconsistencies in at least two of Van Arsdale’s clients’ accounts: the Jane Doe who accused Combs and Jay-Z, and an anonymous male accuser who gave details in a December 2024 interview with CNN that didn’t match his lawsuit, including the year he alleges he was drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs at one of his White Parties. Van Arsdale said the inconsistencies in John Doe’s story were due to a clerical error in filing. After CNN’s interview with John Doe, his firm refiled an amended complaint. Though the civil and criminal cases are separate, Van Arsdale said some of his clients have cooperated with federal authorities in the Combs criminal case and could be called to testify during his trial. “This is an opportunity they maybe thought they’d never had in the fact that they see the system working,” he said. Van Arsdale said he is seeking justice for his clients regardless of the outcome of the criminal trial. “My clients will be ecstatic if and when he’s convicted, guilty and behind bars,” he said. “But the next step in their healing process is the accountability for what happened to them.”",2025-05-08
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/entertainment/3-doors-down-brad-arnold-cancer-diagnosis,"Brad Arnold, the lead singer of the rock band 3 Doors Down, says he has been diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer. Arnold shared the news in a video posted to his Instagram page Wednesday, saying he was diagnosed with stage 4 clear cell renal cell carcinoma. He added that the cancer had metastasized into his lung. “That’s not real good,” he said, adding that he has “no fear” and “sincerely am not scared of it at all.” Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, according to the Mayo Clinic. Arnold said because of his diagnosis, the band is canceling their upcoming tour. 3 Doors Down was set to embark on a tour starting on May 15 in Daytona Beach. All dates have since been removed from the band’s official website, with a video of Arnold’s announcement in its place. Arnold asked his followers and listeners to “lift me up in prayer every chance you get” and joked that he should go listen to their 2008 song “It’s Not My Time.” Creed singer Scott Stapp was among those who gave their support to Arnold in the comments section of his post. “If anyone has the FAITH and STRENGTH to face this fight, it’s YOU brother,” Stapp wrote. “I think I can speak for all of us, we are lifting you up in prayer right now believing without doubt for your total healing!” 3 Doors Down formed in the mid-1990s, with Arnold as one of the founding members.

CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/entertainment/walton-goggins-white-lotus-snl-promo,"Walton Goggins is playing his own game of whodunnit on the set of “Saturday Night Live” before the “White Lotus” star takes the stage as the upcoming episode’s host. In a new promo posted to the “SNL” X page on Wednesday, Goggins pokes fun at the fervor surrounding the hit HBO show in which he starred by jokingly theorizing with “SNL” cast member Marcello Hernandez about “who’s gonna die” at the end of the NBC sketch show’s season. (HBO, like CNN, is a property of Warner Bros. Discovery.) “It’s not that kind of snow, man. It’s ‘SNL,’ no one’s gonna die,” Hernandez says. Goggins goes on to tell Hernandez his “theory” anyway, saying, “Colin Jost, Michael Che, murder-suicide!” “No!” Hernandez exclaims, adding that “these are real people, they’re not characters… no one is dying.” Undeterred, Goggins continues to wildly theorize about who will kill Hernandez, vacillating between cast members Heidi Gardner and Chloe Fineman before finally landing on Bowen Yang, joking, “It would always ever be Bowen, because he hates you.” Just then, like a scene from a horror film, cast member Michael Longfellow comes up from behind and pretends to stab Hernandez, revealing himself as the killer. “I should have been Domingo,” Longfellow says, referencing Hernandez’s viral recurring character. Goggins, living for the moment, then says, “Wow, I did not see that coming! Prestige television!” The “Righteous Gemstones” star appeared in the most recent season of “The White Lotus,” which came to a dramatic conclusion in April. The Mike White-created series is a social satire that follows several different groups of people on vacation at luxe resorts around the world, with each season including a cast member death (or deaths) that is teased in the season opening and then revealed in the finale.

CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/entertainment/ex-model-harvey-weinstein-retrial,"Days into Harvey Weinstein ‘s first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her. But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE’-ah) Sokola’s claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women’s accusations. On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story, according to the Associated Press. Sokola didn’t look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he’s on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction last year, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola’s allegations. As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them. The Polish-born Sokola, 39, is a psychotherapist and author and said she recently launched a film production company. She sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation. Sokola testified that she was never interested in modeling – but rather in acting and writing – but her mother and sister decided she should enter a Polish modeling contest at age 14. She won a contract with a modeling agency and was soon juggling middle school with photo shoots. The next two years “were a very fast growing-up lesson,” she said. By 2002, she was 16 and in New York to make the modeling rounds, without any of relatives on hand. Sokola, who’s expected to continue testifying Thursday, hasn’t been asked yet about Weinstein. Prosecutors have said she was introduced to him while on that 2002 modeling trip to New York. In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward. The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006. Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film “The Nanny Diaries” and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress. “She was proud of knowing him,” her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH’-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday. She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein’s heart health, and then he and the model left the table together. Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later – “like somebody waiting for the result of an exam” or the Oscars – but didn’t say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors. She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article. Weinstein’s lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein’s wealth and influence. Prosecutors have said they began investigating Kaja Sokola’s claims after her attorneys called on the eve of Weinstein’s first trial. But prosecutors set the inquiry aside after he was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed. They revived the Sokola investigation after New York’s highest court reversed Weinstein’s conviction. Weinstein’s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Kaja Sokola’s allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of “smuggling an additional charge into the case” to try to bolster other accusers’ credibility. One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later. The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",2025-05-08

Jalen Brunson made two clutch free throws with 12.7 seconds remaining to give the Knicks a one-point lead, before Mikal Bridges made another game-winning steal, this time on Jayson Tatum, to secure a huge 91-90 win at TD Garden.

Steph Curry out for at least a week after injury in Game 1 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves Teams that win the first two games of a playoff series on the road advance to the next round 85.7% of the time, per the Associated Press. The defending champions are now in real danger of being eliminated with the next two games at a raucous Madison Square Garden. “Two games we’re up 20 points (and) somehow end up not with wins is inexcusable,” Boston star Jaylen Brown, who was the victim of Bridges’ game-winning steal in the series opener, told reporters. “Obviously, being down two, it sucks. “It’s an opportunity to show what we’re made of,” Brown added. “Obviously, we wouldn’t like to be in this position, but we’re here now, so we got to respond.” No team in the history of the NBA has shot more three-pointers than this version of the Celtics, but it has been their undoing so far in this series, going a combined 25-of-100 from deep across Games 1 and 2 – including missing a league playoff-record 45 triples in the opener. The Celtics offense crumbled in the fourth quarter, missing 14 of its final 15 shots that included an incredible run of more than eight minutes without a bucket. It has been a remarkable start to the series for a Knicks team that finished 10 games back from the No. 1 seed Celtics and got swept 4-0 in the teams’ regular season matchups. Josh Hart finished with a game-high 23 points for the Knicks, while Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 17 rebounds. Brunson, the 2024-25 Clutch Player of the Year, had 17 points – including the Knicks’ last six of the game – and seven assists. After shooting 0-for-8 through the first three quarters, Bridges scored all 14 of his points in the fourth before his crucial steal at the end. Bridges said after the game that the team is “just finding ways to win.” For the Celtics, Derrick White and Brown had 20 points, but it was a tough night for Tatum who finished with 13 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Game 3 is at Madison Square Garden in New York on Saturday. The Oklahoma City Thunder demolished the Denver Nuggets 149-106 on Wednesday to level the series at 1-1. Oklahoma set a new NBA playoff record for points scored in a half, dropping a staggering 87 in the first half against the Nuggets. Denver, who fired longtime head coach Michael Malone just before the playoffs, snatched a win in Game 1 with a late Aaron Gordon three-pointer, but Game 2 was never even a contest as the Thunder raced out to a 24-point, first-quarter lead. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a game-high 34 points for the Thunder to go with eight assists and four rebounds, while Chet Holmgren posted a double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds. All five Thunder starters, plus three players off the bench, hit double figures in the rout. Nikola Jokić, Gilgeous-Alexander’s rival for the MVP award, scored just 17 points and fouled out in the third quarter. The three-time MVP had a historic 42-point, 22-rebound performance in Game 1. Game 3 is in Denver on Saturday.",2025-05-08
CNN,Sports,Emilee Chinn/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/sport/rory-mcilroy-return-major-masters-us-pga-spt-intl,"Rory McIlroy says he feels “a lot less pressure” as he prepares to return to major action having ended years of heartbreak with his victory at the Masters last month. The Northern Irishman was finally able to slip on the famous green jacket and enter himself into the record books – becoming the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam of winning each of golf’s four majors – after prevailing at Augusta National, sparking emotional scenes of celebrations. With that monkey off his back, McIlroy returns to major action at next week’s PGA Championship at Quail Hollow. And by ending an 11-year wait for his fifth major title, the 35-year-old admitted that he’s going to arrive in Charlotte, North Carolina, with far fewer expectations on his shoulders. “I’m obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure, and I’m also going back to a venue that I love. It’s nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened a few weeks ago and then with my history there and how well I’ve played at Quail,” McIlroy told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the Truist Championship in Philadelphia. “It probably will feel a little bit different. I probably won’t be quite as on edge as I have been for the last few years when I’ve been at major championships. I’ll probably be a little bit better to be around for my family, and I’ll be a little more relaxed. I think overall it will be a good thing.” Related article
Rory McIlroy could go onto win 10 majors now Masters ‘shackles are off,’ says men’s captain of his hometown golf club There’s a reason for McIlroy to be so confident heading into the second major of 2025. He won the Truist Championship by five shots last year at Quail Hollow when it was staged there and already has gotten off to an excellent start on the PGA Tour this season with two other victories outside of his Masters triumph. This year, the tournament is being held on the Wissahickon Course at the Philadelphia Cricket Club as McIlroy seeks to defend his crown and claim his fifth Truist Championship title in the process. McIlroy said that he’s cherished his time celebrating his Masters victory with friends and family, describing him and his mom being a “mess for a few minutes” when they first saw each other afterwards. “Look, as an only child, I have a bond,” McIlroy said. “I’m lucky, and I know a lot of people feel this, that they have a close bond with their parents, but I think as time goes on and I’m getting a little older, I realize that they’re not going to be around forever. It means even more that they were still around to be able to see me complete the slam and fulfill those dreams.” But he admitted he’s also enjoyed returning to the day job having stepped back into competitive action at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last week. “Good to be here. First week, I guess, as an individual coming back and playing over the last few weeks. I’m excited to get back to being a golfer,” the world No. 2 said.",2025-05-08
CNN,Sports,David Dow/NBAE/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/sport/haliburton-pacers-cavaliers-curry-warriors-timberwolves-nba-spt-intl,"Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry is out for at least a week and set to miss multiple games of his team’s second-round series against the Minnesota Timberwolves after suffering an injury on Tuesday night. The Warriors won Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinals series against the Minnesota Timberwolves 99-88, despite losing Curry to a hamstring injury midway through the second quarter. The team said in a statement that he has a strained left hamstring and he will be reevaluated in a week, meaning he could possibly return for Game 5, which is scheduled for May 14 if necessary. Curry’s injury came on a history-making night in the NBA playoffs. With the Warriors’ win over Minnesota, the road team has now won the first game in each of the four conference semifinals series, the first time that’s happened in league history. The Indiana Pacers took that a step further, grabbing a shock 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals against the No. 1 seed Cleveland Cavaliers thanks to a dagger shot from Tyrese Haliburton to snatch a 120-119 road victory. Here’s how another intriguing evening of NBA postseason action played out. Having stunned the Eastern Conference’s No. 1 seed Cavaliers in Game 1, the Pacers were riding high for the second game of their series. The Cavs were seeking to rebound from a disappointing opening game, but were dealt a big blow when three key players – Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and De’Andre Hunter – were all ruled out through injury. But despite those absences, it was the home team that was in the ascendancy for most of the game, building a 20-point lead at one point as it looked to be heading to level the series. Cleveland’s lead was 11 at halftime, with guard Donovan Mitchell – who finished with 48 points, five rebounds, nine assists and four steals – excelling throughout. But as the game went on, Indiana slowly but surely chipped away at the lead until it was a three-point game with 27 seconds remaining. A key turnover forced by Andrew Nembhard gave the Pacers possession with time ticking away, after which Haliburton was fouled to send him to the free-throw line with 12.4 seconds remaining, trailing by three. What happened next was basketball drama in its purest form. TY!!!!!!!! WHAT A WIN !!!!!! @Pacers Haliburton made his first free throw then missed his second from the line but managed to soar and claim the rebound. The 25-year-old was able to relocate to the top of the arc where he maneuvered the ball until he was able to launch a three-point attempt over Ty Jerome. The ball soared through the hoop with just 1.1 seconds remaining and after a heave from Jerome fell short, the Pacers celebrated their second straight surprise road victory over Cleveland. Haliburton’s shot was his second game-winner of the playoffs already, having done so in Game 5 against the Milwaukee Bucks in the previous round. Per ESPN, Haliburton became only the second player since 1997-98 with multiple go-ahead field goals in the final two seconds in a single postseason alongside LeBron James in 2018. The moment sparked wild celebrations on the court but also on social media from many of Haliburton’s peers, including fellow Indianapolis-based star guard Caitlin Clark who said on X: “TY!!!!!!!! WHAT A WIN !!!!!!” Haliburton was more understated, praising the rest of his teammates. “We just have a resilient group, man,” Haliburton, who finished with 19 points, nine rebounds and four assists, said. “We just figure out ways to win. We don’t give up. We’re battle-tested as a group. We’ve basically been together for about two years now and that continuity has been really good for us.” According to ESPN, there have been only three occasions a team has won after trailing by at least seven points in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime in a playoff game out of 1,643 games since the 1997-98 season, and the Pacers account for two of those three this postseason alone. As the series travels to Indiana for Game 3 and 4, the Pacers hold a two-game lead with the Cavaliers – who had the second-best regular season record in the league – needing a big comeback to salvage anything from this year. The Warriors know a thing or two about winning NBA titles and they showed the resilience needed to make a deep postseason run with their performance in Game 1 against the Timberwolves. Coming off a seven-game slugfest against the Houston Rockets, Golden State raced into an early lead against a sluggish-looking Minnesota team which struggled to get to grips with the Warriors’ dynamic ball-movement and shooting. But Golden State looked to have been dealt a serious blow when two-time NBA MVP Curry was seen clutching his left hamstring in the second quarter before walking gingerly to the locker room. The 37-year-old would not return to the game after scoring 13 points in 13 minutes. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said that Curry had a hamstring strain and the team announced the full extent of the injury on Wednesday afternoon. Golden State led 25-20 when Curry left and, in his absence, the rest of the roster stepped up in a tricky environment. The Warriors led 76-53 midway through the third quarter and although the Wolves clawed their way back, the lead was too big to come back from. With Curry out of the lineup, it was left to other players to shine. Draymond Green had 18 points – including four triples – to go with eight rebounds, six assists and two steals, while Jimmy Butler nearly had a triple-double with 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. Meanwhile, Buddy Hield continued his hot scoring run with 24 points. While the Warriors showed resiliency, the T-Wolves lacked the urgency which saw them beat the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. It was a lackluster performance from their own star guard, Anthony Edwards, who missed his first 10 shots and didn’t get a bucket until four minutes into the second half. He notched 22 of his 23 points in the game’s final 20 minutes, by which time the Warriors already had a large lead. Afterwards, Minnesota head coach Chris Finch called out his star’s performance. “It starts with ‘Ant.’ He struggled early, and then you could just kind of see the light go out for a while,” Finch told reporters. “I think it was one of those games where he came out with a predetermined mindset of what he was going to do.” Finch added: “What is there to talk about? You’re the leader of the team, and you got to come out and set the tone in all ways that that happens, and if your shot’s not going, you still have to carry the energy.”",2025-05-08
