Independent,Business,BlackRock’s billions show it’s not all gloom for UK business,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/stock-markets-blackrock-interest-rates-uk-b2739490.html,"Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism, as Karl Matchett reports I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The mood around UK business has ranged from cautious to desperate in the past few months as the economy battles inflation, tax grabs, rising labour costs and the prospects of US tariffs. Add in constant political pressures giving a bleak outlook and the stock market plummeting in early April on the back of those tariffs, and UK plc could be forgiven for thinking 2025 might become a year to forget. But perhaps all is not as bad as it was beginning to appear, with some important signs giving relief and optimism to some businesses who got a share price backing boost thanks to the world’s biggest investor, BlackRock, building stakes in multiple companies. And the most imminent boost will be a cut to interest rates. The Bank of England meets on 8 May and a 0.25 per cent cut appears all but guaranteed at this stage. And back-to-back rates cuts are entirely possible, bringing the Bank Rate down to 4 per cent by summer. It would be the first time since March 2023 that the interest rate returns to that level, easing costs for business owners with debt and perhaps allowing more consideration to investment on projects and other spending which could spark opportunities for the growth the economy desperately needs. Some businesses already look well-positioned to capture that growth, believes Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock. “[The company has] allocated more capital back to the UK tactically now with the belief that in the short run, the new administration is trying to tackle some of the hard issues,” Mr Fink toldThe Times. “I think the prime minister is articulating the needs of what we have to do. I have more confidence in the UK economy today than I did a year ago.” Pointing to some of the financial institutions that had seen their share price hammered this year as the FTSE 100 dropped along with other major stock markets, Mr Fink explained how BlackRock had taken stakes in different sectors in the belief the selloff was overdone. “So many of the UK stocks discounts were too deep, especially like in the banking system. Look at the rebound in the valuations of NatWest and Lloyds and how they bounced. We added to our positions across the board with the idea that we believe the market was discounting too much negativity. And we believe the negativity was probably not warranted,” he said. Having seen a significant drop from 3 April onwards, the FTSE 100 - the biggest firms on the London Stock Exchange - have bounced back somewhat and now remain up more than two per cent since the start of 2025, even if they have collectively not reached March’s high points. Interest rate drops - while affecting households in terms of mortgages, savings accounts and so on - also impact investing. That is in part due to lower guaranteed returns from cash or like-cash holdings, meaning more risk may be taken on in the form of stock market equities. Rising share prices help improve investor and business confidence, while consumers may then benefit from having more money in their own pockets if rate drops mean they pay less on mortgages and other debt. There are further positives in other sectors. Retail sales rose almost half a percent in the UK during March, and that came ahead of April when the rise to minimum wage kicked in meaning more money in some workers’ pockets. Jacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said: “Glimpses of warmer weather and improving consumer confidence meant retail sales continued its upward trend in March. Sales volumes rose for the third consecutive month, reaching their highest level since July 2022. The first quarter of 2025 suggests consumer spending is slowly starting to return, which should provide some reason for optimism in the retail sector.” Then there’s analysis from Barclays, showing both wage growth easing and contraction in employment. Both of these factors will further ease pressure on the Bank of England when it comes to deciding rates cuts. Small wins they might seem, and with little impact of individuals, but as we so often see in businesses, it’s those small wins adding up continuously which lead to the potential to outperform. Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism.

Independent,Business,Why Tesla’s fall forced Musk to step back from DOGE,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/tesla-elon-musk-doge-profits-share-price-stock-b2737802.html,"A 71 per cent drop in profits and tanking share price have forced Elon Musk to cut down his time as Trump’s costcutter-in-chief. Alicja Hagopian and Karl Matchett explore what happened I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice At the start of the year, Tesla’s share price was at an all-time high. Elon Musk, owner of the electric vehicle giant, was coasting on the win of his ally Donald Trump, and investors were hedging their bets that soon-to-be-President Trump would enact policies in favour of Tesla and the billionaire’s other companies. But with an astronomical fall in share price, tanking sales and shrinking profits, the reality for Tesla has been far different – and much of it is tied to Musk’s public-facing role in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla stock once made up the majority of Musk’s wealth, but now it is reporting huge drops in profit. The decision to step away from DOGE may show that Musk is not immune to Tesla’s downfall. Within one month of Musk’s appointment to DOGE, Tesla shares were down 16.5 per cent. Within two, Tesla’s share price was down 45 per cent from when Trump came into office. And Musk himself has lost an estimated $149 billion in wealth since taking the helm at DOGE; at $301 billion compared to $449 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Tesla’s share price problems have been far from cosmetic. The business is facing significant headwinds, not least because of the intertwined reputation with its notorious leader. In January and February, Tesla sales in Europe saw sudden dips, of 45 per cent and 39 per cent respectively year-on-year - despite steady growth in the European electric vehicle (EV) market. The numbers behind this week’s latest earnings reports are, as expected, not pretty. Quarterly profits of $409m contrasted starkly with last year’s $1.4bn figure for the same three months - and the 71 per cent drop represents the company’s lowest quarterly profits since 2020. Actual vehicle sales reported this month were down 13 per cent to a little over a third of a million across the January to March quarter, with notable declines in China and parts of the US, while revenue of $19.3bn fell short of forecasts by more than $2bn and operating margins fell to 2.1 per cent. “Earnings margin of 2.1 per cent is the lowest since Tesla approached break-even in 2019,” said Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “Free cash flow dipped to $660 million, but did not enter negative territory as capital expenditures were nearly halved compared to the prior year due to reduced investments. “Tesla has [also] effectively removed its growth guidance for this year, no longer promising a return to growth in 2025.” Additional factors affecting sales include competition from China’s BYD (Build Your Dreams), which undercuts Tesla on price, while frequent recalls of Tesla vehicles may also be doing little to boost confidence in the brand. But it is impossible to ignore a major factor impacting its brand: Musk’s growing unpopularity. Musk has made no secret of his increasingly controversial political viewpoints. From accusations of a nazi salute at the inauguration, to criticising Volodmyr Zelensky as “evil” over the war in Ukraine, it is easy to see how his actions have ruffled feathers. As a result, a string of attacks have targeted Teslas in Europe and the US over the past few months, with clear anti-Musk messages. Tesla owners have faced threats to sell their cars over “Nazi Extremism” in California, while even in the UK, campaign groups have applied pressure against Tesla cars and charging points. Tesla shareholders are pushing back against Musk’s alignment with Trump; his decision to step partly away from DOGE indicates Musk is likely feeling the blowback himself. Investors may have hoped that Musk’s role in the administration would see carveouts for Tesla in Trump’s trade war. But in fact, the electric vehicle brand is far from immune. Tesla manufactures its electric vehicles in the US, which makes it less exposed to 25 per cent automotive tariffs than foreign brands. But the tariffs are not just on finished cars; there is also a 25 per cent levy on all imported automotive parts, and Tesla relies on many parts imported from China, in addition to Mexico and Canada: the company is dependent on imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to fuel its EVs, in particular using Chinese manufacturer CATL to supply its factories. And China’s new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets have also impacted other projects from Tesla such as its Optimus humanoid robots. With Tesla dependent on batteries and rare earth products from China, the trade war will inevitably hit its supply chain. Following Tesla’s plummeting profits, it might have been expected that the share price could drop further - but the opposite has happened. On Tuesday, the share price had risen 4.6 per cent; following the announcement of Mr Musk’s intentions to resume greater oversight of corporate rather than Capitol Hill activities, that trajectory continued. Tesla shares are up more than seven per cent in pre-trading, set to open well above $250 per share - still a far cry from December’s peak. Lowered expectations can explain part of it, as well as a broader desire from investors to see a bull run resume - from lower share price starting points. “Tesla’s first-quarter delivery and production numbers were as ugly as its Cybertruck design. That meant expectations were rock-bottom in the run-up to its financial results and it’s why the shares didn’t tank upon release of the Q1 earnings,” noted Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. “Certain individuals are spotting an opportunity and might take the view that Tesla’s significant share price decline has gone too far - they’re buying on the dip, hoping for a bounce-back and might view the recent sell-off as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pick up shares in a previous stock market darling on the cheap. After all, the fundamentals still give bulls something to get excited about.” Not everyone is quite as excited about those humanoid robots, self-driving taxis and energy storage products though. “While Tesla is making progress on these initiatives, we believe the market and management commentary are overly optimistic about the timing. The narrative around Tesla’s stock and valuation remains heavily dependent on these future prospects,” Valechha cautioned. It should also be noted, the uptick isn’t totally down to Tesla, Musk or anything to do with electrification - Trump’s China tariff climbdown has sent the S&P 500 two per cent higher in pre-trading, with the likes of Amazon and Nvidia up four per cent each. Market volatility comes as standard in this second Trump term, and for Tesla which inadvertently became a crossover company to the political arena, that continues to go double.

Independent,Business,"Co-op prioritises corporate greed over animal welfare, says Chris Packham",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/coop-prioritises-corporate-greed-over-animal-welfare-says-chris-packham-b2752877.html,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice TV presenter Chris Packham has urged the Co-op to stop the sale of so-called “Frankenchickens” as he blamed the “greed of the corporate world” for prioritising profit over animal welfare. The broadcaster and naturalist joined demonstrators outside the supermarket’s AGM in Manchester. They are calling on the chain to ditch fast-growing chickens raised for meat, known as “Frankenchickens”, from its supply chain. “Frankenchickens” are bred to produce the maximum amount of meat in the shortest amount of time and can reach a slaughter weight of more than 2.0kg in five to six weeks, according to animal welfare charity The Humane League. Speaking to the PA news agency from the protest, Packham said the rapid growth rate of the chickens puts a “horrendous” burden on the “physiology and the anatomy” of the birds. “Basically, they’re taking on too much weight too quickly for their skeleton to cope with it, and we see all sorts of hideous deformities and muscular problems in the chickens, they end up scrabbling around in their own excrement, which is acrid and burns their skin off,” he said. Some supermarkets justify their use of “Frankenchickens” by arguing some customers cannot afford meat raised in better welfare conditions, the environmentalist added. “There’s an ethical problem there to start with and that is that people on lower incomes should have as much right to exercise their choices when it comes to the ethics of animal welfare as anyone else,” he said. “That is entirely wrong to say that people can’t afford to make an ethical choice – well, that affordability is in the hands of the Co-op. “They’re the ones that are setting the price and we know full well that supermarkets sell some of the items on their shelves at loss to lure us in, where they make a profit on other items.” Of the price difference between chickens raised in higher and lower welfare conditions, Packham continued: “The interesting thing is, I need to be very clear about this, the increase when it comes to chicken is in pence, not pounds. “It’s pence we’re talking about here, so this is basically the greed of the corporate world, once again, striving to maximise its profits at the expense of high welfare standards.” On his message for Co-op customers, Packham said: “The pound in our pockets or purses is incredibly powerful. “If we don’t buy it, they won’t sell it because they’re interested in making a profit.” A motion proposed at the Co-op AGM (annual general meeting) two years ago to stop the chain using “Frankenchickens” was passed by 96%, but since then “nothing has happened”, he added. Another motion on phasing out the use of the fast-growing chickens was passed at Saturday’s AGM with 90.94% voting in favour. According to the motion, the Co-op is supplied with more than 10 million chickens, 98% of which are “Frankenchickens”. A spokesperson for the Co-op said: “Animal welfare is extremely important to us and our members, and we work hard to ensure all the animals in our supply chain are looked after. “All Co-op fresh chicken is 100% British, reared in lower-stocking density environment and exceeds Red Tractor standards, placing us significantly ahead of most other retailers for chicken welfare. “We will explore all opportunities to continue to improve animal welfare across our supply chain, whilst also considering the impacts on British farming, on the environment and the prices our members and customers pay in store.” Claire Williams, campaigns manager at The Humane League UK, said: “If human babies grew as quickly as Frankenchickens they’d weigh as much as an adult tiger at two months old – that’s nearly 300 kilos. “These birds have been bred to suffer; their lives are marked by pain, stress and burden. Yet so-called ethical retailer Co-op continues to sell them. “This urgently needs to change.” Members at Saturday’s meeting also voted in favour of ceasing “all trading” with Israel following the conflict in Gaza. Citing the Co-op’s previous decision to “boycott Russian products” following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the motion read: “We urge the board to show moral courage and leadership, apply the same ethical principles and values it did to Russia, and take all Israeli products off the shelves.” The board said it will consider the thoughts of members expressed by the non-binding vote. The motion passed with 72.8% voting in favour. The supermarket chain is currently recovering after a major cyber attack caused significant disruption including bare shelves in many of its shops in recent weeks.",2025-05-18
Independent,Business,Tax avoidance is on the rise – and the rich are leading the way,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/tax-avoidance-rachel-reeves-wealthy-b2752364.html,"New figures show that tax worth billions of pounds a year is being dodged, writes Chris Blackhurst. And despite repeated promises by the chancellor, it is the wealthiest who appear to be getting away with it the most It has taken the government spending watchdog to highlight what has long been suspected, that ministerial claims to be cracking down on tax avoidance come nowhere near the mark. Listening to them, and not only Labour but Tory ministers in recent years, you could be forgiven for supposing that Britain is a state where shielding wealth from the HM Revenue and Customs’ prying eyes is confined to the past. This was Rachel Reeves in her party conference speech last September: “We will crack down on tax avoidance and tax evasion.” And again, in her spring statement, proclaiming the Treasury will tackle “fraud committed by the wealthy, fraud facilitated by those in large corporations, and by individuals and companies who make it possible for others to hide money offshore”. Here is the Conservatives’ Jeremy Hunt, when chancellor in 2023: “We are against all fraud and all tax evasion, and we will continue to work very hard to reduce the tax gap.” To be fair, you could take your pick of any chancellor or shadow chancellor during the last few decades and you will find a speech lambasting tax avoidance schemes accompanied by a ringing pledge to bring them to an end. In its report, the National Audit Office (NAO) warns that the tax gap, the difference between the amount the HMRC believes is due and how much is collected, has risen, which “raises the possibility that underlying levels of non-compliance among the wealthy population could be greater than thought”. This was evidenced by a fall in penalties imposed on the wealthy – defined as those earning more than £200,000 a year or with assets of more than £2m – from 2,153 notices totalling £16.2m in 2018-19 to 456 worth £5.8m in 2023-24. This was over a period when the number of rich individuals in the UK grew, from 700,000 in 2018-19 to 850,000 in 2023-24. This weekend’s Sunday Times Rich List showcases how the rich generally become ever richer and brings the issue into annual sharp relief. Reeves announced tax rises aimed at the wealthy in her first Budget, including reducing the advantages enjoyed by non-doms, increasing capital gains tax and imposing VAT on private school fees. She also moved against winter fuel allowances, changed the inheritance tax rules for farmers and increased employers’ national insurance. While this latter group are going ahead and their effects will be felt, it is clear from the NAO’s findings that the wealthy have ways to escape what was aimed at them. This does not include non-doms who are closely defined and the code that applies to them is simply applied. The reaction of many of the non-doms has been to leave the UK for other countries which are only too glad to welcome them and the money they invest and the jobs they create. In this regard, Reeves is extremely short-sighted. No, it is more about the consistent failure of politicians to clamp down closer to home. They always talk a good game but their performance in office is lamentable. Alas, the same cannot be said for Reeves’ quick hits of winter fuel and the rest – the less well-off are easily clobbered and have no way out. There will likely be a repeat in Reeves’ next budget, due in the autumn, as the softening-up exercise is well underway, with signals appearing suggesting extra money must be found to pay for public services and heightened defence commitments. Brace yourselves for further tax increases is the message as we head into the summer. As well as possessing the ways, the wealthy have the means. It does not take rocket science or even the spending of more than a few minutes to gauge the scale of the UK industry devoted to avoiding tax (evading is illegal and is therefore not so brazen). There are advisers galore, all willing to engage in what is euphemistically called “tax efficiency” for a fee. Those with the largest pots of cash can avail themselves of impenetrable trusts arranged for them in the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and further afield in the likes of Gibraltar, Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands. Bizarrely, given the “can do, will do” boasts about launching renewed tax drives against the UK wealthy, all the places where UK firms boast of maintaining offices and connections are ours; they are UK-protected. Nothing meaningful is ever done to curb this offshore trade. Along with tourism, it represents a lucrative source of income. Better it occurs, reasons the Foreign Office that oversees them, than they suffer and come cap in hand for London’s financial and welfare support. In her Budget, Reeves provided additional funding for HMRC that specifically included tackling offshore non-compliance. But in its report, the NAO urged ministers to redouble their efforts to secure more of the money owed to the Exchequer. Billions of pounds, concludes the watchdog, are going unpaid each year. Additional steps were required to make sure the wealthy paid their fair share. That did not deter a spokesperson for HMRC from still insisting in relation to the NAO report: “It’s our duty to ensure everyone pays the right tax under the law, regardless of wealth or status. The government is delivering the most ambitious ever package to close the tax gap and bring in an extra £7.5bn for public services per year by 2029-30.” So, we can look forward to the NAO scrutinising in the future and being satisfied, then?

Independent,Politics,The £25bn-a-year prize at stake in Starmer’s Brexit reset talks,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-uk-eu-reset-trade-deal-starmer-b2752285.html,"A failure to land a deal for easier trading with the EU could cost the UK economy almost £30bn, new analysis shows I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice A £25bn annual boost to British exports is at stake for Sir Keir Starmer as he tries to secure a Brexit reset deal at a crucial summit on Monday, analysis shared with The Independent reveals. Removing trade barriers on goods, including food and drink and electrical items, could result in a 2.2 per cent uplift in gross domestic product in the long run, boosting the economic growth the prime minister so desperately wants to deliver, financial analysts Frontier Economics found. And a separate assessment by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) warns that a failure to land a deal for easier trading could lead to a 2.7 per cent drop in exports by 2027, costing the UK economy almost £30bn. The impact on the British economy from such a deal is expected to dwarf that of the agreements recently signed with India and the US. On Saturday night, Sir Keir said it would be “good for our jobs, good for our bills and good for our borders”. Gordon Brown’s former economic adviser Lord Jim O’Neill summed up the importance of Sir Keir’s summit in London: “Obviously, the closer and more serious we can get, the better it is for reversing our net trade losses, and importantly, net investment from EU areas. “Given the shock from Trump [tariffs] to Europe, especially on Germany, on top of the Ukraine shock and China slowdown, I think Germany [will be] more open to pro-UK trade issues than before. “Also, I suspect the EU is going to give more than lip service to cross-border services sector reform now. Given UK net advantages in service sector exports, this is important to us.” Such reforms could make it easier for the UK to sell services to the bloc by allowing mutual recognition of qualifications so UK professionals can practice in the EU and vice versa without having a retrain. NIESR’s interim director Stephen Millard said the value of Monday’s deal should not be underestimated. He said: “In 2024 we exported roughly £6.5bn to India, roughly £53.5bn to the United States and roughly £159bn to the European Union. It is fairly clear from those numbers that a trade deal with the European Union is much more likely to shift the dial than the deals with India and the United States.” His assessment was echoed by Chris Southworth, director general of the UK’s largest business organisation, the International Chambers of Commerce, who noted that the trade deal signed with Donald Trump, which saw tariffs slashed on UK car and steel exports, was a “damage limitation agreement” and only accounted for 13 per cent of international gross domestic product (GDP). But he fears the deal to be unveiled on Monday “may not be ambitious enough” especially if it only focuses on goods rather than the future growth areas of digital services. It is a view shared by the Labour chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee Dame Emily Thornberry. In an interview with The Independent, she called on Sir Keir to be more “courageous”, adding: “We should be going further than the government currently seems to have the ambition for doing.” The deal is expected to include closer defence cooperation, goods and services, and a youth mobility agreement, which would allow 18- to 30-year-olds to live and work in the UK and Europe for a time-limited period. It has also been reported that it will include an agreement to allow EU trawlers to fish in British waters. Two immediate big wins could be to include the UK in the €150bn (£126bn) EU defence procurement fund, which would allow the government to bid for military equipment contracts and invite them to join the EU data hub. The latter is being championed by Poland, who currently have the presidency of the EU. A special report from earlier this year found that Brexit had cost the UK £30.2bn in settlement costs, stopped 16,400 businesses from exporting to the EU, and could lead to a 15 per cent long-term loss of trade. From the £24.8bn export boost for the UK estimated by Frontier Economics in a report commissioned by pro-EU group Best for Britain, farm food exports alone could see a £3.2bn increase. Agricultural exports have suffered since Brexit, with food and drink exports down by more than a third, according to trade bodies. The EU, meanwhile, would also benefit, with a £22.4bn boost to exports in goods and services from a closer agreement, selling £5bn more in agricultural products. Amar Breckenridge, senior associate at Frontier Economist, said that some of the economic damage caused by President Trump’s tariffs could be offset by the benefits of a closer EU trading relationship. While tariffs could still cost the UK £4.3bn in GDP under the new US trade deal, Mr Breckenridge estimates the UK could claw back £8.1bn from closer trading with the EU. The long-awaited youth mobility scheme alone could boost GDP by 0.45 per cent in the next decade, according to a separate study from the Centre for European Reform. But recent reports suggest that the deal might hit speed bumps in a row over high student fees for EU students coming to the UK, in addition to a lack of flexibility over the amount of fish EU countries can take from British waters. On youth mobility, John Springford, associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform, noted: “The youth mobility scheme would raise GDP by bringing more young EU workers into the UK labour force – although the final numbers will depend on how many are allowed to come and how long they can stay for.” Introducing it could amount to 31,000 more young people a year coming to the UK at the highest end, which would mean more people working and contributing to the economy. But EU officials want lower fees for their students, according to reports, which is causing tension ahead of Monday’s talks. International students currently pay around £12,000 more in fees on average per year than domestic students. The number of EU students at UK universities has dropped by nearly half since Brexit, with 75,000 EU nationals enrolled in British colleges and universities in the 2023/24 academic year – down from 148,000 in 2019. The Independent estimates that UK universities generate around £1bn a year in extra fees from EU students, which is likely why the government is facing domestic pushback over lowering fees. However, according to research from the London School of Economics, lowering fees would have a positive impact because EU students spend around £61,000 here over the course of their studies, on top of their tuition fees.

Independent,Politics,Talks over winter fuel U-turn ‘intensify’ as Labour bids to woo voters,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-reeves-winter-fuel-uturn-labour-b2752608.html,"Prime minister Keir Starmer under pressure as focus groups tell government they might not bear a grudge if there is a reversal of the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s cuts I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer is poised to reverse controversial reforms to his government’s infamous winter fuel payment cuts as soon as June, according to reports. The move could allow the party to repair its damaged relationship with voters and tackle the threat from Nigel Farage and Reform UK. Rachel Reeves’s decision to strip 10 million pensioners of the payment within weeks of taking office has proven toxic for her party and was a key issue during last month’s local elections, which were disastrous for Labour. Discussion on the policy within No 10 has intensified after focus groups of voters showed Labour could be forgiven for the move if there was a full or semi-U-turn, according to The i Paper. And, asked during a trip to Albania whether he was considering changing course, the PM refused to rule out making more people eligible for the allowance. Ministers are considering whether to give more pensioners the allowance, by increasing the £11,500 income cut threshold over which they no longer get the payment or by reversing it altogether, the paper reported. It comes as No 10 is also facing a potential Labour rebellion next month when changes to welfare are voted on in the House of Commons. More than 100 Labour MPs have signed a letter raising their concerns about the cuts. In the wake of the elections, which saw Reform win more than 500 council seats, Sir Keir publicly ruled out an outright U-turn, telling broadcasters, “we had to stop the chaos, we had to stabilise the economy”. But just hours before, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, failed to rule out a reversal of the policy. Senior Labour figures have also joined calls for ministers to restore the payment to at least some of those affected. A Treasury spokesperson pointed The i to Ms Reeves’s repeated denials that she will change course. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “We had to take tough but right decisions in the Budget to stabilise the economy after years of damage and decline. “As a result of what we’ve done, [we have] got record investment into the NHS, which is bringing down waiting lists and delivering three million extra appointments in the first 10 months of a Labour government, with four interest rate cuts and growth figures of 0.7 per cent. “The decisions we made weren’t easy. But it’s clear they are having the effect of stabilising our economy and allowing our economy to grow, putting more money in the pockets of working people.” Ministers insist they had to cut the allowance to repair the public finances following a £22bn “black hole” left by the previous government. The policy is expected to save the government around £1.5bn a year, but will push more than 100,000 pensioners into poverty. The change is more widely known than any of Labour’s other policies, while around two-thirds of voters dislike it. Luke Tryl, executive director of polling organisation More In Common, has described it as Labour’s “original sin” and said it had a major impact on the party’s disastrous performance in this month’s elections.

Independent,Politics,Hundreds of MPs and peers call for Starmer to ban Iranian army,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-iran-revolutionary-corps-tehran-b2752882.html,"Three Iranian men in London were charged with spying offences after a counter terror probe I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer is facing calls from hundreds of MPs and peers to ban Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) amid a deteriorating human rights picture in the UK and after three Iranian men were charged with spying in London. Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock is among those urging the prime minister to outlaw the IRGC, warning “the human rights crisis in Iran continues to worsen”. It came as three Iranian men living in London were charged under the National Security Act, accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service. More than 550 MPs and peers, also including former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and ex-home secretary Suella Braverman, signed a letter criticising Iran’s “hijab and chastity law”. They said it “mandatory hijab, suppressing women who lead the protest and resistance movement to prevent future uprisings”. “Appeasing this faltering regime betrays democratic values, emboldens its repressive policies, and undermines global security as Tehran continues its nuclear ambitions and terrorism,” the letter said. It added: “Given the regime’s complete blockade of all avenues for political activity, the international community must recognise the Iranian people’s right to regime change. “The IRGC should be designated as a terrorist organisation,” the letter said. The UK has previously resisted calls to ban the IRGC over fears it could sever the country’s diplomatic link with Tehran. But Tory MP Bob Blackman, chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee, said “it’s time to change course on our Iran policy”. Mr Blackman, who coordinated the letter, said: “Our ally, the US, rightly designated the IRGC as a terrorist entity several years ago. While the regime has never been weaker, we must set aside all wrong-headed political and diplomatic calculations and proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist entity — an action long overdue.” Following the recent arrests and charging of the Iranian men, Mr Blackman said: ““Iranian terrorism has reached our soil. A serious terror plot, involving several Iranians, was recently thwarted in the UK.” The letter came as Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori were charged with engaging in conduct likely to assist the Iranian foreign intelligence service between last August and February. Sepahvand was also charged with engaging in surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research, intending to commit serious violence against a person in the UK. Manesh and Noori have also been charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance, with the intention that serious violence against a person in the UK would be committed by others. Former Tory MP and minister David Jones said there is a “growing consensus among UK politicians that the time for a new policy on Iran has arrived”. The MPs backed Iranian opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran’s 10-point plan to “end the religious dictatorship and transfer sovereignty to the people’s representatives”. The group calls for an end to compulsory hijab and religion, an end to dictatorship and executions and a democratic Iranian state. The Foreign Office was asked to comment. Following the charges brought against the three Iranian men, Yvette Cooper promised to strengthen national security powers. The home secretary said: ""I want to thank the police and security services for their continuing work on this very serious investigation, and for their immense dedication to protecting our national security and the safety of our communities. ""The charges that have been laid against these three individuals must now take their course through the criminal justice system and nothing must be done to prejudice the outcome of those proceedings. ""But we will also take separate action to address the very serious wider issues raised by this case. ""The police have confirmed that the foreign state to which these charges relate is Iran, and Iran must be held to account for its actions. ""We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-18
Independent,Politics,Starmer accused of ignoring foreign press at post-Brexit reset summit,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-brexit-uk-eu-summit-b2752848.html,"A foreign journalist said news wires from Spain, Italy and Germany have been denied access to the EU-UK summit on Monday I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of shutting European news outlets out of his much-hyped EU-UK summit on Monday. With the prime minister set to unveil his post-Brexit reset plans alongside Brussels leaders, the Foreign Press Association (FPA) has said “almost every European news outlet” with a foreign correspondent in London has been denied access to the summit. In a letter sent to Downing Street the FPA, which represents foreign journalists based in the UK, said: “Sir Keir Starmer, you state that you want a reset with the EU. You organise a summit between the UK and the EU to restart the relationship. “Yet you deny accreditation to almost every European news outlet who has a foreign correspondent in London, leaving out the biggest news agencies, the most important papers, the most trusted broadcasters. “The Foreign Press Association in London represents the top international news outlets in the world, the vast majority of which have been denied access to Monday’s summit. “We urge you to reconsider, if not out of a consideration for press freedom at least out of fairness.” One journalist hoping to attend the summit said two of their countries biggest news outlets had been shut out, comparing it to shutting the BBC and PA out of a summit in Brussels. The reporter said: “I believe it is a complete and utter shambles. They have denied access to public broadcasters and news wires from Spain, Italy, Germany and many other countries but granted it to freelancers. “Either they have no understanding of who the key players in European media are, or they simply don’t care.” Government officials said they had received 500 accreditation requests for only 100 spaces, with the majority of those 100 awarded to European outlets. “We always accommodate as much as we can,” a source stressed. Monday’s summit is the culmination of months of negotiations between the UK and EU on the future of Britain’s relationship with Brussels. The prime minister will be joined by European Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa as they set out a path forward. Major announcements include the expected unveiling of a youth mobility scheme between the UK and EU, which would let young people live, work and study freely between Britain and Europe. Britain is also hoping to secure access to the EU’s major 150 billion euro defence fund, which would be a significant boost to the UK’s arms firms.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Simon Armitage: ‘It’s not my job to bring the nation together’,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/simon-armitage-interview-poet-laureate-hay-morrissey-b2750393.html,"The esteemed writer speaks with Claire Allfree about the misconceptions of his royal role, why all nature poetry is now innately conservationist – and that infamous and ‘scary’ Morrissey interview I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The second poem in Simon Armitage’s new poetry collection is titled “Drey” – a reference to the small hanging baskets of branches in which squirrels live. Armitage describes a drey as a “twig and leaf crow’s nest squat/ wombed with feathers and moss”. I hadn’t heard of the word before, I tell him. “It often comes up in crossword clues,” the poet laureate replies, in his unusually slow, deliberate voice. “Although if you spell it with an ‘a’, it has something to do with beer barrels: ‘A brewer’s dray.’ There’s a richness there. But I was really thinking about animal habitats, and I realised each animal home has a specific word. Almost like an address.” That conceit is at the heart of Dwell – a playful, magical set of poems, each one devoted to a different habitat in the British landscape. There’s the usual – “Pond”, “Sett”, “Lodge” and “Web “(or “trampolines of death” as the 61-year-old puts it) – but also lesser-known abodes like “Scrape”, the home of a hare, and “Hibernaculum”, the underground shelters used by hibernating animals. Armitage imagines a hedgehog curled up like “spiky boxing gloves”. The poems are like miniature stories, combining his conversational style and startling lyrical precision with that sly narrative wit: “Deer Diary”, for instance, is an elegantly structured tease that plays on that animal’s elusive character and sense of mystery. The poems were commissioned by the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall, where they will eventually become inscribed into the earth and foliage, in the form of installations, recordings and sculptures, “like an alternative guided tour”, as Armitage puts it. (He’ll also be reading from them later this month at the Hay Festival.) “The Gardens [which date from the 18th century and have since become Europe’s largest restoration project] are very manicured, very exotic, almost tropical,” he says. “But the animals you find there are very British. And that’s fortunate because we are losing species hand over fist. Despite the Gardens being almost foreign, they have become a refuge.” Environmentalism has been at the heart of Armitage’s wide-roving nature poetry for years. It’s unavoidable. Yet he dislikes the idea that his poems might be seen as a form of campaigning. When I tell him Dwell put me in mind of Robert Macfarlane’s The Lost Words project, which set out to reclaim common nature words that are falling out of use among children, Armitage replies sniffily: “I didn’t want to tell children what words they should use and what they shouldn’t. I didn’t want to be didactic.” Certainly, Dwell is often very funny: “Insect Hotel” consists of snippy Airbnb-style reviews from its various diverse residents. “Horrendous. Brought the kids with us but next morning they’d been eaten by a Dunnock. Two thumbs down.” Armitage argues that the great pastoral tradition that has sustained English poetry for centuries has lost its innocence. Or rather, its complacency. “Poetry has definitely got its money’s worth out of nature,” he says. “Nature has been both backdrop and sentiment, and there has been the sense that it would be there for ever, always available to be exploited for all these artistic purposes. But that world doesn’t exist any more. Whenever you write about nature these days you are involved in conservation.” Even the wild, magnificent poetry of his beloved Ted Hughes was concerned with this, Armitage says. “Hughes wanted to capture the wonder of nature. Wonder can be ecstatic, and it can also be terrifying. In recreating that, he made us want to taste more of it, and to live in a world where that could exist.” Armitage is talking to me over Zoom from his attic garret in his house in Yorkshire, where he lives with his second wife, the BBC radio producer Sue Roberts, a few miles from the village of Marsden where he grew up (the couple have a daughter, Emmeline, a national slam poet champion in her twenties). I can’t give any more details because he has blurred out the backdrop on his screen, meaning only his face is visible. “I hadn’t tidied up,” he says a bit sheepishly, although it later transpires that he is oddly oblivious to his surroundings anyway. “I’m always being told I don’t notice things, particularly in the garden.” Surely this is rather strange for a poet? “Oh, I’m a very poor looker. But I think I dwell on things instead. I’d rather encourage people to think rather than see.” He’s been encouraging readers gently, wryly, sometimes emphatically and often beautifully throughout a career stretching more than 30 years. Armitage became poet laureate in 2019 – it’s a 10-year post, which he is just over halfway through. More than any living exemplar I know, he defies the popular image of a poet as a wan aesthete producing impenetrable verse from a lofty ivory tower. There is something hewn from the earth about him, something tangy and stubborn, solid and rooted. He talks this way too, choosing his words carefully and thoughtfully, his voice plain and flat. He can also be the teensiest bit chippy. In his time as poet laureate, for which he is paid in sherry (a staggering 720 bottles a year), he has more than stepped up to the plate as the nation’s poetic avatar, responding not just to the big national events such as royal deaths and coronations, but to smaller, less obvious moments, too. He has just completed a set of poems that have been inscribed, in ship’s brass, into the new shore defences in Portsmouth. This has tickled him since he studied geography at Portsmouth Poly but spent his time writing poems instead. “And now I’ve got the chance to put a bit of poetry into the geography,” he says, delighted in a very dry, Simon Armitage kind of way. Yet he is not at all keen on questions about being poet laureate. “The nub of being poet laureate seems to be being asked what the point is of being poet laureate,” he says. “It’s almost a full-time job. And royalty is like catnip for journalists. So, I’m slightly unwilling to talk about all that.” I suspect this reluctance is at least partly because he intuits that some might regard a working-class poet from Yorkshire (if I were to guess his politics, I’d swing left) as being slightly incongruent with a job that has clear establishment connotations. He avoids political messaging in his poetry, which encompasses the tenderest of love poems and the GSCE staples “Poundland” and “Hitcher”, but his plays tend to have sharper teeth. Both his 2015 dramatisation of The Odyssey and his version of Hansel and Gretel for Shakespeare’s Globe were deeply concerned with the contemporary refugee crisis. Being poet laureate is about writing the best poems I can When I ask whether today’s sharply polarised cultural landscape makes his job of being poet laureate particularly challenging, he shuts down. “I don’t see it as my job to bring the nation together,” he says. And: “I refer you to my previous answer. I see it as being about writing the best poems I can.” Fair enough. He’s certainly a terrific ambassador for the form – a trustee of the National Poetry Centre, which plans to open a national home for poetry in Leeds in 2027; a former poetry professor at Oxford and Sheffield; a current professor of poetry at Leeds; and a regular presence on TV and radio. Alongside several plays, he has produced acclaimed translations of Homeric verse and the medieval epic Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and has published more than 20 original collections. He is also the lead singer of LYR (Land Yacht Register), which released its debut album in 2022. A year later, he published a book of song lyrics, Never Good with Horses. He is a music nut. Incidentally, he is also known for an infamous interview he conducted with his hero Morrissey for The Guardian in 2010. During that sit-down, Morrissey made an ugly racist comment about Chinese people, which made headline news at the time. Armitage has often refused to talk about that conversation and its fallout – but now, he says: “It was quite a scary period of my life. Morrissey was a powerful and, I assume, wealthy individual and I’d reported what had happened in good faith in a way that allowed people to make up their own minds about it. And it had blown up way beyond the interview. Lawyers were all over it. It became very uncomfortable.” Did Morrissey’s comment affect how Armitage felt about his music? “I don’t think it did. I think I had recognised Morrissey as someone who could drop bombs. I still listen to the Smiths. I don’t judge people by fractions and portions of what they have said. If Joseph Lister had turned out to be an absolute bastard, I’d still be taking antibiotics.” Later, perhaps feeling he hasn’t answered sufficiently, he emails me to elaborate more broadly on the issue of cancel culture. “It troubles me when people are vilified for making mistakes, or worse, if they’ve been trying to do the right thing but have used the wrong language or made an error of judgement [Morrissey, who is an animal rights advocate, made his comments in the context of China’s deplorable record on animal welfare]. There are enough truly terrible people in the world without having to aim hatred at those who’ve innocently or accidentally or inadvertently strayed from the course of righteousness. “And I don’t think we should strip away the cultural furniture of our past, no matter how unworthy it now seems. Just put a different sign on it and give it a new context, a reminder of how and why we’ve changed, and from what. We need to know what we were like.” Lawyers were all over the Morrissey interview. It became very uncomfortable Armitage never intended to become a professional poet. Instead, after earning an MA in social work in 1988, he followed his father into the probation service in Manchester. He left in 1994, overwhelmed by some of the horrors he had witnessed, and devoted himself full time to poetry, having already published his first collection, Zoom!, five years earlier. For some time, Armitage regarded his new career as a clean break from what he had been doing before. Now he thinks the two things are inextricably related. “At the time I absolutely rejected the idea that I’d become some sort of social worker in verse, because when I left the service I wanted to escape its orbit. But I can see now I’ve carried on working with some of the same sensibilities and sympathies,” he says. “I’ve written a lot for marginalised people, people who’ve had their voices taken away, who are damaged or broken. And I have found some pleasure in realising writing poetry wasn’t just escapism.” Armitage agrees that, perhaps more than any other genre, poetry gives voice to the dispossessed. “That’s why it is such a humane activity, because it recognises the individual viewpoint instead of mass ones.” What, though, does he feel about its future? AI, decreased attention spans, declining literacy rates: surely all pose an existential threat to one of the oldest art forms in the world? “One of the joys of translating medieval poetry is that it’s often anonymous [the Sir Gawain manuscript, for example, is by an unknown author]. We don’t know who wrote these pieces but it’s an incredible thrill to know they came from the soul of a human being who lived 800 years ago. AI, if it becomes good enough, will deny us that. It’s intriguing, but it’s also devastating.” He despairs at how mobile phones are destroying the way we daydream. “People ask me where poems come from and I talk about the importance of letting your mind drift into a contemplative state, where you might collect a bit of language, a bit of a story, and from a poetry point of view, that can be the beginning of a piece of work,” he says. “But we deny ourselves that now because every time there is a lull, we get out the device and it tells us what to think. That’s very worrying for poetry because it’s the art form of concentration.” I suggest to Armitage that we no longer know how to be bored. “Yes, and that’s a real shame, because I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when there was absolutely nothing to do, and it led me and my mates into doing some extraordinary things.” He thinks In Praise of Boredom would make a good title for a book. “I’d certainly buy a book called that.” ‘Dwell’ (Faber & Faber) is out now.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,All eight Mission: Impossible movies – ranked from worst to best,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/mission-impossible-ranked-movies-b2751802.html,"As the perpetually building-climbing Ethan Hunt faces ‘The Final Reckoning’, Adam White and Louis Chilton rank all eight of the Mission movies (so far?) – from the one with Philip Seymour Hoffman to the one with all the slow-motion doves I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Our mission, should we choose to accept it? Ranking every film in the Mission: Impossible franchise. In the years since the classic 1966 espionage TV show was rebooted by Brian De Palma in 1996, Tom Cruise’s action franchise has gone on to become a modern Hollywood stalwart. While the films took a while to really find their footing, Mission: Impossible has also been one of the most reliably enjoyable franchises out there, with every entry having something to recommend it: balletic fight choreography; audacious, death-defying stunts; Shea Whigham. As such, ranking the films largely comes down to personal taste. (Though you can probably guess which entry takes the lowest spot. That’s right: that one.) The latest film in the franchise, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, is out in cinemas next week, and serves as a direct follow-up to 2021’s Dead Reckoning (originally titled Dead Reckoning – Part One). Described by The Independent’s critic Clarisse Loughrey as “an inherently absurd” film that “also reaches such highs that it’s hard to really be that bothered”, The Final Reckoning looks poised to be one of the franchise’s most divisive films to date. Here is The Independent’s ranking of every Mission: Impossible film, from the 1996 original to Final Reckoning… Putting John Woo’s uber-glossy sequel in bottom place here is a little like declaring The Godfather Part III the worst of that trilogy: well, obviously. But while M:I-II struggles with self-seriousness and is a little too in love with its innumerable latex-mask plot twists, it’s still often incredibly fun. You’ve got Cruise with long hair, Thandiwe Newton giving a Mission: Impossible version of Catwoman as a slinky thief, and Metallica and Limp Bizkit providing the music cues, for goodness sake. Do you remember a single thing about Dougray Scott’s elaborate scheme to steal a lethal virus? Probably not. But you will likely recall how this film possesses arguably the greatest bit of terrible-amazing dialogue in the history of cinema: “This isn’t Mission: Difficult, Mister Hunt,” intones mysterious spy poppa Sir Anthony Hopkins, “it’s Mission: Impossible”. Huzzah! The latest – maybe last – instalment in the series annoyingly reflects the best and worst instincts of these things. There is a brilliant lightness of touch to the action here, notably a scene in which Ethan dangles perilously off the wing of a prop plane, but there’s also a stodginess and an almost Marvel-coded devotion to legacy and callbacks that weighs it down. The Final Reckoning is also long, clocking in at a grand 170 minutes, with at least 60 of those not especially earned. Perhaps it’s a villain problem – Esai Morales’s anonymous Gabriel and the all-seeing artificial intelligence known as The Entity, both introduced in 2023’s Dead Reckoning, remain far too silly to work. Or it’s the fact that this film has reportedly been filmed, edited and endlessly tweaked for close to three years. Either way it feels too worked-on, as if no one could particularly figure out what the finished product should be. This is, of course, still largely entertaining. But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if it marked the end of the road. JJ Abrams made his feature directorial debut here after David Fincher dropped out (imagine!), and it can’t help but play like an extended episode of his TV series Alias as a result. That long-running spy drama cast Jennifer Garner as a secret agent attempting to preserve some semblance of a private life – and Ethan more or less goes through the same predicament here, as we meet him in the midst of marital bliss with Michelle Monaghan’s lovely Julia, who is ignorant of her husband’s espionage escapades. Overall, the pacing is a little off and the set pieces aren’t particularly novel – Cruise took a salary cut as Paramount were nervous about spending big on this one – but it has one major ace up its sleeve: Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a slippery arms dealer, is unsurprisingly brilliant here, and comfortably remains the franchise’s greatest villain. There is such shiny ease to Christopher McQuarrie’s handling of these characters and the form of these movies that Dead Reckoning is by and large a total pleasure. The set pieces remain breathtaking (a Venice car chase featuring Ethan and Hayley Atwell’s ebullient pick-pocket Grace in a tiny vehicle is the highlight) and there is a knowing silliness to the increasing absurdity on display: Vanessa Kirby playing Hayley Atwell playing Vanessa Kirby is exactly the kind of nonsense these films have perfected of late. But the attempts to grant Ethan a tragic backstory never really come off – Mission: Impossible hasn’t historically needed this type of thing, so why start now? – while the demise of Rebecca Ferguson’s marvellous Ilsa Faust shamefully unravels all the rewarding time spent in the two previous movies not making her just another one-shot female character in this franchise. In light of The Final Reckoning, it may be Mission: Impossible’s proper jump-the-shark moment. The wince-inducing sequence in which Ethan climbs Dubai’s Burj Khalifa skyscraper still holds the title for most impressive stunt in these films, which makes it slightly curious that director Brad Bird wasn’t invited back. Still, he did an impressive job of kicking the franchise into a new era. There is a noticeable split down the middle in Mission: Impossible just as Christopher McQuarrie (unbilled here but responsible for reworking the script mid-shoot) enters the picture. The films are suddenly funnier, more graceful in their ambitious stunt-work, and more rooted in ensemble-cast teamwork. But there are also growing pains: Jeremy Renner’s short-lived, possible Ethan replacement is deeply bland, while Michael Nyqvist’s nuclear strategist ended up the blueprint for this franchise’s increasingly rote villains. It practically goes without saying that MI6 agent Ilsa (“Rebecca Ferguson best of the yellow satin dress” has been viewed more than 26,000 times on YouTube, I should add) is an incredible shot in the arm for these movies just as they began to risk overkill. She’s the first Mission: Impossible supporting character – and certainly first female character – who feels as if they are Ethan’s conceptual equal: heroic, complicated, slightly maddening in their derring-do. Beyond Ilsa, though, Rogue Nation is a smooth operation, heavy on spectacle (that cargo plane opening sequence!) and moving at a brisk clip, as Ethan and his team take on The Syndicate, aka secret agents who’ve gone bad. It’s quite remarkable how little Brian De Palma’s first film resembles what the franchise would ultimately become – and how quickly his brand of chilly, paranoid menace was excised. It makes it slightly difficult to rank, and I wouldn’t necessarily blame anyone who finds it a tad dull. But it’s incredibly distinct as these movies go, tense and occasionally macabre, with flashes of stylish violence. It sees Ethan accused of murdering his team (among them Kristin Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez), before attempting to identify a traitor within the ranks of the Impossible Missions Force. There is such visceral thrill to the set pieces here – the massacre of Ethan’s comrades, the fish tank and the exploding bubble gum, that iconic dangle on the wires – that it’s difficult to ever dislike it. And the erotic charge to Ethan’s tangle with Vanessa Redgrave’s elegant arms dealer makes you miss when these films weren’t quite so chaste. The actual storytelling in Fallout is largely nonsensical. It’s something about suitcases of plutonium, and features far too many monologues that frame Ethan Hunt – and by extension, Tom Cruise – as the closest thing to Jesus Christ for the agents of the IMF. But holy smokes is Fallout just sensational as an action film. The Paris motorcycle chase. The speed-run along the South Bank. That cliff-edge helicopter closer. It’s all just so, so relentlessly fun. You also wonder, in light of the Reckoning two-parter, whether this would have worked better as a finale than a sixth film in an eight-movie franchise: story arcs come to a close, Henry Cavill – as a moustachioed hired gun – reloads his fists like they’re pistols, and Cruise snaps his ankle on camera.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Netflix’s Forever radically reimagines Judy Blume – but for the better,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/forever-netflix-judy-blume-cast-book-b2752408.html,"Blume’s willingness to treat teen fiction with the utmost candour has always ruffled feathers, writes Micha Frazer-Carroll. Netflix’s provocative new adaptation gets at the core of what makes the author such a unique and vital figure Recently, in a bout of morbid curiosity, I rescued from my parents’ house the stack of diaries that I had religiously kept throughout my teenage years. I was surprised by what I found – the near-daily entries didn't read like the juvenile and mundane scrawlings of the strait-laced secondary school student I remembered. Younger me wrote lucidly about her sexuality; her shortcomings; the complexities of her friendships. She described not only her feelings, but her feelings about her feelings. She did this with more candour than I think I am often capable of as an adult: there was something unabashed and rich about the life I had been living inside of my head. When adults underestimate children, I think we are often engaging in this kind of flawed self-referencing – not simply minimising “young people” as an abstract group, but revising, patronising and selling short our younger selves. Judy Blume, whose 1975 book Forever has this month been adapted into a Netflix series, was never one to do this. The American author has sold over 82 million copies of her books since the late 1960s, and is credited with having shaped the contemporary young adult genre; she has said that she remembers her childhood vividly. This much is obvious – you only need look at the way that her stories have managed to connect with young people across generations. In Judy Blume Forever, a 2023 Prime Video documentary about the author’s life and career, scores of children in archival footage of book signings marvel at her ability to articulate their thoughts and feelings. One girl says that Blume understands her better than her parents. To many, though, Blume’s realness was threatening. The housewife-turned-author’s books were full of discussions of masturbation and breasts and period blood and handjobs, peppered among the day-to-day teenage stuff. Forever, which candidly charted an emerging romantic and sexual relationship between high school seniors Katherine and Michael, was perhaps the most controversial of all. One mother told The New York Times in 1978: “I’d rather have my daughter read pornography than Forever.” While the sexual content meant critics and even Blume’s own publisher dubbed it a book for grown-ups, it seemed that adults were the ones most scandalised by it – with Forever being banned intermittently in the US until as recently as 2024. But the continued censorship of Blume’s work just goes to show how political her stories have always been, despite being ostensibly written for kids. And while adapting her work remains a daunting proposition (for all the factors listed above), Forever proves that Blume remains both universal and timeless. The Netflix TV show, created by Mara Brock Akil, captures perfectly the spirit of Blume’s writing, with a few twists. Katherine and Michael become Black Gen-Zer Keisha (Lovie Simone) and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), old classmates who cross paths at a house party full of mostly white teens. Tonally, the show starts out feeling relatively twee – an innocent portrayal of young love, sprinkled with trips to the mall and the movies. Then, all of a sudden, there’s sex. I don’t mean euphemistic, offscreen or sanitisingly alluded-to sex, but an incorporation of sex that feels just as surprising and jarring as when I stumbled across it in my own teenage diaries. I didn’t necessarily find its appearance jarring because it was young people doing it, but rather, I didn’t expect these seemingly sweet and innocent young people to be doing it, in this particular show. It was as if a plotline from Euphoria had wandered its way onto the set of Heartstopper. While there are parallels to the book, Akil also makes obvious departures. The Blackness of the show isn’t confined to its casting – it’s threaded throughout the script. Keisha wears a headscarf to bed and shares her dreams of going to the historically Black Howard University, while Justin’s mum aspires for her son to settle down with a Black girl. It’s also firmly situated in the 21st century, with a large chunk of the romantic tension emerging through text messages, and thorny present-day realities of teenage sex – like revenge porn – taking a front seat. These creative choices might take some adjusting to for loyal Blume fans, some of which are entering their fifties and sixties. But these choices also carry forward the political spirit of Blume’s work, which often goes unnamed. While Blume’s characters don’t usually talk politics explicitly, the sexual content in many of the author’s books mirrored the broader societal rebellion of the Sixties and Seventies. Gabrielle Moss, author of Paperback Crush: The Totally Radical History of '80s and '90s Teen Fiction, tells me: “Books like Forever reflected the massive changes that women were experiencing in US culture at the time, in a way that pretty much no one else writing for young people did. In short, Blume brought the feminist and sexual revolutions to teens.” It was, and still is, notable, that Forever is about a “nice girl” who has sex – written on the request of Blume’s then teen daughter Randy, who bemoaned tragedy narratives in which rebellious girls have sex, get pregnant and are either sent away or die via self-managed abortions. Moss tells me that, in this context, Forever was one of the only resources to learn about sex in a healthy way. “Sex education class at school wouldn't teach you about the pleasures of sex, just the dangers. Forever floated the idea that a teen's first sexual experiences could honestly be pretty wholesome – a simple, pleasant part of their growth into an adult. I think that's still a pretty radical idea.” Akil’s unapologetic adaptation of the story, about a “nice Black couple” falling in love, also brings the daily realities of a different social movement to its audience. Episode one opens with an argument between Justin, who is an aspiring basketball player, and his mother, who doesn’t think it’s safe for a young Black boy to go out to a party late at night: “We got cops out here shooting Black boys like it’s open season – and I’m trippin’?” While some might dub these themes “mature” for younger viewers, their inclusion shows an awareness of what young people are exposed to in the real world, just as Blume’s books did. Amid the politics, Akil’s depiction of a young, wholesome Black love also feels quietly radical. Blume didn’t initially license Forever for adaptation, fearing it wouldn’t translate to today. But the series’ eight episodes boldly step up to the task of adapting such a beloved, canonical author. Director Kelly Fremon Craig, who adapted Blume’s groundbreaking Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret as a film in 2023, told Variety: “You can feel like with every change you make, someone is going to be like, ‘Why would you change that?’ Like painting over a Picasso.” Akil’s Forever doesn’t shy away from that, and simply grabs a new canvas. It seems that the strength of Blume’s work lies not in its universality, but its ability to actually describe the specifics of young life to children, to take that responsibility seriously, and to tell the truth. ‘Forever’ is streaming now on Netflix Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-18
Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,How Twenty One Pilots became the streaming era’s biggest band,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-anniversary-b2749674.html,"Blending genres and tackling themes of mental health, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun surged to global fame and chart-topping success. On the 10th anniversary of ‘Blurryface,’ Ali Shutler talks to the band about their memories of that crucial time in their lives I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Twenty One Pilots are the biggest alternative band to come out of the streaming era by any metric. As you’d expect, their songs are a fluid blend of clashing genres that want to turn uneasy fears into cause for celebration. While you might not recognise the band name, you’ll definitely know the tracks: a couple of them have been streamed more than 2 billion times on Spotify. This week, their unlikely breakthrough album Blurryface turns 10. Taking inspiration from a lifetime of musical touchpoints, the band toyed with rock, reggae and indie-pop across Blurryface. It was messy and jarring, there was a lot of ukulele, but the whole thing was delivered with so much conviction; it worked. “We did want to make something that felt new,” admits vocalist Tyler Joseph. “But we weren’t looking over the top of our small fan base, trying to reach this broad audience. That just happened.” And it happened hard. Released on 17 May 2015, Twenty One Pilots’ fourth album was the first crossover album post-Spotify, and perhaps the last proper breakout rock record. It instantly hit No 1 in America and reached No 14 in the UK, but went on to spend 120 weeks in the Top 100. “We didn’t even know what getting a ‘No 1’ meant,” Joseph admits with a grin. He, just like bandmate, drummer Josh Dun, is guarded in interviews, sincere in song and not afraid to be a little silly onstage. Nothing much changed for the two-piece at first as they set off on their already-announced Blurryface world tour, but things began to snowball. In November, they played a sold-out headline show at London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire to 2,000 fans. The following February, it was Brixton. In November 2016, it was a trio of gigs at Alexandra Palace with more than 30,000 in attendance. “That’s when we realised something was happening,” says Dun. Away from the road, Blurryface was racking up numbers on streaming as well. The chirpy funk of “Ride” soundtracked the summer before the wistful, nostalgic slow-burn of “Stressed Out” took over the radio, won them a Grammy and remains one of the most played songs on Spotify. With well over 2.6 billion plays, it’s above rock party staples such as The Killers’ “Mr Brightside”, Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and Oasis’ “Wonderwall”. Two years after it was first released, Blurryface became the first record in history to have every track certified gold in America, with the synth-driven “Hometown” the final song to crack 500,000 sales. There was such hunger for more that their previous record Vessel achieved the same lofty milestone. Just last month, “Doubt” went viral on TikTok. “It’s only looking back now that we fully realise just how much of a beast that album was,” Joseph says backstage at Madrid’s Movistar Arena ahead of another sold-out show. An early version of Twenty One Pilots formed in 2009 while Joseph was studying at Ohio State University, but things really came into focus when he teamed up with Dun in 2011. The pair built a loyal following through scrappy but ambitious local shows and were eventually signed to Noughties pop-punk powerhouse label Fueled By Ramen (Paramore, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At the Disco) for third album Vessel. It was a moderately successful record, tapping into the same soaring electro pop that had made superstars of Hozier and Cage the Elephant, while their DIY two-man show already featured costume changes and backflips. But unconventional song structures and spoken-word, metaphor-heavy lyrics about depression meant the band felt like a cult concern ­of the near future – especially in 2015. Digital downloads may have given kids the ability to listen to all sorts of music, but streaming made it compulsory – and the industry didn’t know how to react. After dominating youth culture throughout the Nineties and 2000s, rock music was in decline (in 2017, hip-hop would officially usurp it as the most popular genre), and bands were fighting to stay relevant. Established acts turned to radio-friendly pop while a new generation were adding half-hearted EDM sections to their snotty pop-punk anthems and claiming they’d always loved hip-hop. Rather than chasing rapidly changing trends, Twenty One Pilots wrote on the road while touring Vessel and wanted Blurryface to be full of songs that would help them create the perfect setlist for their live show. That’s still the driving force today, says Dun. “We knew we had an audience that trusted us and that was very freeing,” adds Joseph. “It felt like we could go in any direction we wanted.” Enjoy unlimited access to 100 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial.

Radio hits definitely weren’t what they were aiming for, though. “I remember finishing ‘Stressed Out’ and just thinking ‘Cool, another song done. We’re that much closer to having this record finished,’” says Dun. Their producer even advised them against including the now iconic pre-chorus “My name’s Blurryface and I care what you think” that anyone under 30 has definitely sung along to at least once. Ten years ago, not a lot of people were really talking about mental health, how they were doing, or what was going on inside their heads. “I had to explain to him that it was going to make sense to the fans,” says Joseph. “That it was a character with a backstory, as well as the name of the album. He trusted us, but I could see it on his face: ‘This song isn’t going to be a hit.’” “[We had] such ignorance and confidence at the same time,” adds Dun. The band used the album to introduce the world to Blurryface, a mysterious character that allowed the pair to confront their own anxieties. For live shows, Joseph would use black makeup to paint his throat and hands to represent the hold those fears had over him. “I feel more uncomfortable listening to the album now than when it was released,” he admits, not realising quite how revealing some of those songs were. “Still, writing about mental health on a major label record release was cake compared with trying to explain to our dads what we wanted to do with our lives.” “Ten years ago, not a lot of people were really talking about mental health, how they were doing, or what was going on inside their heads. But speaking to fans after shows, those conversations were very normal for us,” Dun adds. Like Green Day’s American Idiot and My Chemical Romance’s The Black Parade before it, the story of Blurryface connected with a generation of kids who were struggling; typical teenage growing pains amplified by the rise of social media. “It felt like there were all these rules about making music back then. I know I spent a few years before I got into Twenty One Pilots refusing to listen to anything that wasn’t pure guitar music,” says London-based artist Noahfinnce, 25, who now makes chaotic punk music but was inspired by the band to throw in the occasional electronic breakdown. “Twenty One Pilots were in that pop-punk, emo scene, but they didn’t sound like any other band around. It takes balls to not give a s*** about fitting in.” He believes the record connected with so many people because of how open the lyrics were about mental health, but also because of the strong visual world the band built around Blurryface. Online music fandom was at its peak thanks to sites like Tumblr and how accessible the internet had become, before Twitter turned those virtual communities into unmoderated shouting competitions. “Nowadays, everybody is in a fandom because everyone is online,” Noahfinnce explains. “Back then, it was this die-hard community that really gave you a sense of belonging.” In interviews, Twenty One Pilots acted like putting out a hugely influential album was all part of the master plan. They took their trousers off before walking onstage to collect their first Grammy, fulfilling a promise they made to each other years earlier while watching the ceremony at home in their pants when nobody knew who they were. “We’re big fans of not putting a ceiling on our ambitions. Whatever you could imagine is probably what we’re going for,” Joseph told me back in 2015. “It was a bit of a defence mechanism,” he admits today. “Josh [Dun] and I really did talk about what we wanted to accomplish when we started this band and so when it was all happening, we weren’t looking at each other and going ‘Can you believe this?’, we just kept saying ‘This is what we talked about.’” But there’s a big difference between talking about sold-out arena tours and actually spending two years on the road. “We weren’t really given any time to appreciate what was happening. We also didn’t allow ourselves to understand it, because it just seemed too overwhelming.” “It’s only now, talking to you, that we start to go ‘Wow, that album really was crazy.’ It was such an insane moment in our career.” Before the hype of “Stressed Out” had died down, Twenty One Pilots had another hit with “Heathens”, their prickly outsider anthem of community that had been written for the not-very-good Suicide Squad movie. It also set their stall out for what was to come next. Instead of chasing viral highs by repeating the many tricks they’d nailed on Blurryface, the band went deeper with knotty follow-up album Trench. The record rapidly expanded the lore to include a plucky band of freedom fighters rebelling against a gang of oppressive “bishops” in the fictional city of Dema and expanded the band’s sonic palette with emo, industrial metal and rap-rock. They headlined Reading and Leeds festival the following year and regularly sell out arenas across the world, but nothing has matched the success of Blurryface. “We didn’t realise how difficult it was to accomplish some of the things that we did with that album,” Joseph admits. After a detour into Eighties synth pop with Scaled and Icy, last year’s Clancy reached No 3 in the Billboard 200 (behind Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish) and acted as the conclusion to the Blurryface story. Does Joseph think there’s more for him to explore with Blurryface? “That’s a good question,” he replies, not wanting to give too much away. “That album is about cycles; trying to improve yourself, inevitably failing, and having to get back up and try again. We wrote it when we were in our twenties and now, 10 years later, there are still things we’re trying to figure out.” Whatever Twenty One Pilots do next, Blurryface continues to be a hugely influential record. Mouthy punk revivalist Yungblud, American hardrockers Halestorm, and TikTok darling James Marriott have all taken inspiration from the band, and they’ve got fans in Sean Paul, Muse and Billie Eilish. “I grew up on them. They have put out some incredible projects and said some of the most real things that I think I’ve ever heard,” Eilish said before the release of debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, which very much follows in the footsteps of Blurryface. A decade on, their fans are still dressing up in the latest battle paint, working together to decipher clues and sharing their own interpretations of the songs, the lore and the future. Despite the brooding subject matter, there’s a lot of hope in that community. “It absolutely changed rock music,” Emily Garner, Kerrang’s deputy editor and long-time member of Twenty One Pilots’ fanbase the Skeleton Clique, explains. Rock purists might hate them for further eroding genre lines and introducing trigger pads to the scene, but they also made alternative music a more experimental, open place. “To me, Blurryface’s impact is only a positive thing. [Tyler] Joseph’s words paved the way for other lyricists and their music opened up new doors for so many of today’s most exciting bands to walk through”. Twenty One Pilots also showed the industry that complicated concept records weren’t just for the overly nerdy portion of their fanbase. Nowadays, Ghost, Sleep Token and Bring Me the Horizon have all proudly built entire eras around complex narratives, and have been given the budget to flesh those ideas out. “We all want to get completely lost in these stories, and Twenty One Pilots proved that if you create honest, authentic worlds, there’ll be people out there who will wholeheartedly resonate.” Of course the success of Blurryface also comes down to a little bit of luck and a little bit of magic. Joseph calls the record “accidentally” great, while Dun says most of their confidence came from “encouraging” conversations with fans. “There is this pressure for new artists and legacy acts to keep casting their net wide to collect as many new ears as possible,” Joseph continues, reflecting on the album’s legacy. “But in doing that, you can sometimes forget the people that are already your fans. Blurryface was a good lesson for us in the importance of the people who’ve already said ‘Yes, I’m in.’” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-18
Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"At Eurovision, politics once more intrudes upon this former pop lark",https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/eurovision/eurovision-2025-review-uk-israel-austria-b2753000.html,"Viewers had plenty of time to revel in the bombastic anguish and madcap pop schemes on former ‘The Voice’ rejects, but politics still overshadows Eurovision’s post-war ideals I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice “We’re off to the races!” declares Graham Norton as the camp action gets underway at Basel’s St Jakob arena in Switzerland. And thus it falls once more to Eurovision to sashay into the bloody-toothed geopolitical scrum, plonk down a boombox playing the Vengaboys and try to get a savage world to sing about saunas for four hours. The ‘Vision, with its post-war ideals of unity through cheese-pop, wasn’t made for violent division within its ranks, nor at all ready for it. In recent, turbulent years it has become as much an international PR exercise as song contest, pinioned by its supposed non-political ethos as its participants make it ever more overtly political. This year, as in 2024, the main source of controversy is Israel’s involvement in the event through contestant Yuval Raphael. You might call it war-washing. You might argue that a global TV audience of 180 million should sense the level of solidarity abroad for the suffering Palestinian civilians, even through the TV feed’s “audio-sweetened” crowd noise. But there’s a sour note to what Norton calls “a mixed response” of cheers and jeers for Raphael herself on the night – a survivor of the 7 October terrorist attack on the Nova music festival who was selected by public vote as something of a national heroine. The song given to her by committee, “New Day Will Rise”, might even reflect the hopes of the general Israeli public for compassion, peace and renewal. “Everyone cries, don’t cry alone,” Raphael sings amid much Broadway bombast and slashes of Middle Eastern strings. “Life will go on… darkness will fade, all the pain will go.” That said, to sing it on an opulent, crystal-drenched staircase while our newsfeeds are full of emaciated Palestinian children in bombed-out homes still feels like a provocative move. “New day will rise,” great. But for everyone? Thankfully, producers have put Raphael on fourth, allowing plenty of time afterwards for viewers to pack their brains into cold storage and revel in the bombastic anguish and madcap pop schemes of the continent’s many regional The Voice rejects. Another major relief is that there’s been a significant scaling back in the sort of occult folk horror presentations that, since Sweden’s xenomorph crossbreed Loreen won in 2023, have made recent Eurovisions prime recruitment drives for Golden Dawn. The only serious hold-outs are Latvia’s Tautumeitas, six fire goddesses full of smiling menace, singing of “curses and hexes” and nature consuming the modern world, then growing monkey tails. The title of their glitch pop chorale “Bur Man Laimi” might translate as “A Chant for Happiness” but it sounds like an ominous evocation for Dead Can Dance to rise again and claim our souls. Instead, a sci-fi fantasy vibe prevails. Opening the evening, Norway’s Kyle Alessandro resembles Elliot Page starring in a musical Dune, roaming an Arabian pop volcano in post-apocalyptic warlord garb, flanked by hand-spinning mercenaries. Ziferblat, Ukraine’s elven village of an entry, resemble a Legends of Zelda game having come to life and become obsessed with the band Yes. And Poland’s Justyna Steczkowska and her crew of moon-worshipping S&M savages are even strafed by a fire-breathing dragon as she sings the song of the goddess Gaia herself, “creator of your DNA, your soul’s destruction and your salvation”. And an eternal deity who’s made it here having previously placed 18th in 1995 and co-hosted Polish Dancing on Ice. The theme for 2025, it seems, is The Elements. Fire and ice pyro and visuals abound, and there’s an entire nautical themed section an hour in. Austria’s impressive soprano JJ – looking to replicate the opera-pop success of last year’s winner Nemo – sets sail into stormy ballad waters on a boat made from bedroom detritus, giving his “Wasted Love” big cologne advert energy. Then Iceland’s Væb – dubbed the Viking Jedward – offer up some cheerier, cheesier seafaring fare with a song about rowing to Greenland on a Minecraft boat beneath leaping Lego dolphins. Later, Greece’s bespectacled chanteuse Klavdia sings of a mother mourning her daughter on the haunting “Asteromasta” while standing on a black pier above burning water. Ahab pop ahoy? In more traditional Eurovision quarters, The Netherlands’ Claude is the sole representative of the once ubiquitous overblown soul-pop balladeer, his “C’est La Vie” a poignant tale of his asylum seeker mother singing to him as a child, performed to his younger self in a mirror. The pop divas put on a strong fem-power showing. Luxembourg’s Laura Thorn, a marionette in a retro-futurist treehouse operated by giant CGI hands, delivers a superbly catchy cartoon twist on Sabrina Carpenter’s biting showgirl feminism. Malta’s Miriana Conte might have had her cunning ploy to slip the queer culture phrase “serving c***” into Eurovision foiled when the BBC insisted the easily-misheard original title of her entry “Kant” be changed to “Serving”, but she injects copious “queen energy” into its rap-pop celebration of forging one’s own riotous path. And, who knows, maybe the line “Why should we let other people decide when we could be having the time of our lives?” might somehow further the Europe-wide case for Universal Basic Income. Denmark’s Sissal seems to be singing the goth-flecked EDM of “Hallucination” from the depths of a K-hole meltdown – all blurred vision, paranoia and lack of control. Yet, love being her drug, she trips jubilant balls throughout. And Erika Vikman, representing both Finland and the more specialist corners of OnlyFans, is a Teutonic rave rock dominatrix whose (ahem) rousing “Ich Komme” is basically a Euro-“WAP”. Having already promised “my gates are open” and “I’ll dance with you even a wedding waltz, but naked”, she ends up riding a giant, spark-spewing golden microphone stand howling a simultaneous orgasm of a chorus like a phenomenally horny Andrew WK: “I scream out loud ‘I’m coming’ and together we come”. A harsh lesson in watching Eurovision with your parents and the subtitles on. After which, the understatement of Switzerland’s Zoë Më seems a refreshing Eurovision revelation: just her, a beautiful swell of chamber ballad and an arena of phone lights. France’s Louane also knows that less is amour, singing her touching ode to finding purpose in motherhood “Maman” (having lost her own parents in childhood) from inside a simple egg-timer set. These are certainly welcome feminine contrasts to Armenia’s none-more-macho PARG, running across the stage to the Imagine Dragons-aping “Survivor” looking like he's fresh from a fight to the death atop Mad Max’s battle tanker. It's a premium year for rock entries too. Lithuania’s Katarsis are probably the finest austere grunge goths ever to brave this arena of garish gimmickry. And Italy’s Lucio Corsi – a cross between 1973 Brian Eno and a malnourished Scarlet Pimpernel – brings probably the best song of the night in “Volevo Essere Un Duro”. It’s a Ziggy Stardust glam rock cracker played on a mile-long piano. There’s even an enlivening rock-off between previous rave metal entrants Käärijä and Baby Lasagna in the pre-voting interval. A kind of Eurogonks Assemble. But what, you ask, of the nutters? Well, the less said about Estonia’s rubber-limbed, coffee-loving Tommy Cash and his flapper cabaret catalogue of Italian cliches the better, but “Bara Bada Bascu” from Sweden’s besuited sauna bros KAJ is hooky enough to stand a chance of becoming the first novelty track to ever win. Even our own Remember Monday do us proud, strutting around a wonky chandelier like Frozen doing a Queen medley about owning your most Hasselhoff-sized blackouts. They hold their own in the jury voting too – receiving douze points from a creepy Italian mouse puppet will rival Churchill’s most stirring speeches in our nation’s proud history – even if the baffling public votes rob them of the showing they deserve. Against the odds, and thanks in large part to Switzerland’s three mildly demented presenters being so proud of their country having invented LSD, for the best part of four hours the joyous Eurovision spirit prevails and the unruly world seems a glittering neon curtain away. Until, in what Norton describes as “the most tense voting we’ve ever sat through”, a huge public phone-vote turnout for Israel makes for a highly charged final stand-off between Israel and Austria, and politics once more intrudes upon this formerly big fun pop lark. Ultimately Austria’s JJ prevails, the second successive opera-pop winner. Expect future Eurovisions to be awash with tracks resembling rave remixes of Tosca. And for the event to become ever more about optics than earworms.",2025-05-18

Read our Privacy notice Sterrato comes to the Giro d’Italia today as stage nine of the 2025 edition takes in some Strade Bianche-esque gravel sectors. There are even some shared sectors with the famous Classic - won by Tadej Pogacar in dominant fashion this year - in Monteaperti and Pinzuto, and five gravel sectors in total, with the longest two both 9.3km. Starting in Gubbio and heading through the Tuscan countryside to Siena, this should be both a fascinating stage to watch and also an incredibly hectic one as all the riders - particularly the GC contenders - look to stay safe on the five sterrato sections. Gravel has no respect for the pink jersey and the risks of punctures, crashes, and mechanicals all feel heightened on the uneven ground, while the dangers of being caught out of position will mean an almighty fight to be at the front. Like Strade Bianche it’s very up and down but the biggest climb is early on at La Cima, a category three 52km in, with another in San Martino in Grania on a sterrato section with 35km or so to go until the finish line in Siena. Other key moments include today’s Red Bull kilometre, at the end of Colle Pinzuto, a 2.5km gravel sector with 14km to go. Six, four and two bonus seconds are on offer there which an enterprising breakaway may well hoover up - or the GC contenders may come into play. The iconic Piazza del Campo plays host to the finish at the end of 181km of racing. Stage nine is scheduled to start at 1pm local time (12pm BST) and should conclude by 5.30pm local time (4.30pm BST). Mathias Vacek has been superb on all terrain in this race so far and had a more relaxed day on stage eight so should have fresher legs, while Dylan van Baarle has a fine Classics palmares and looked lively in the breakaway on Saturday. Inevitably plenty of riders will fancy this one but we’re going to throw our weight behind Tom Pidcock: a former winner of Strade Bianche, he’s evidently in good form after a strong Spring Classics campaign and a third place on a tough uphill sprint finish on stage five to Matera, and he’s made it clear he’s targeting this one. The 25-year-old has never won a senior Giro stage and only has one Grand Tour stage to his name, the famous Alpe d’Huez scalp in 2022, and would no doubt dearly like to add to that.

Independent,Sports,Fisher suffers nightmare KO by Allen as score is settled in rematch,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/fisher-allen-2-result-knockout-highlights-rematch-b2753072.html,"After Fisher won a controversial decision in December, Allen left no doubt on Saturday – stopping his friend at the end of round five, as the towel also came in I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Johnny Fisher was stopped by David Allen in the fifth round of their hotly anticipated rematch at London’s Copper Box Arena on Saturday. The pair met on home soil to settle the score, after a controversial result five months ago saw the scorecards declare Fisher the winner in Riyadh. In their first clash, Fisher emerged victorious on two of the judges’ scorecards with tight margins of 95-94. The third judge scored it 96-93 in favour of Allen, underlining just how closely matched the two heavyweights were that night. History repeated itself as Allen delivered a knockdown yet again in the fifth round – two this time, in fact. But, unlike the first time out, Fisher was put down for good on this occasion, as the second knockdown proved decisive right on the bell. The arena floor was bouncing as Fisher was announced in the ring, and as the bout played out, the “Romford Bull Army” continued to echo Fisher’s name around the venue. Fisher, who was pegged as the favourite to win, was doubling up on shots in the second round as he landed uppercuts to Allen’s body, but he was soon warned for tapping Allen on the head. Allen came back with some jab action, but the 33-year-old wasn’t bringing speed as his 26-year-old opponent was. From the corner, before round three, Allen told coach Jamie Moore, “I’ll be quicker,” before finding himself up against the ropes. Yet it was largely the “White Rhino” fighting on the front foot. Fisher looked like he was hurting Allen with numerous body shots, but during the fourth round his promise to Moore rang true, as Allen landed his first clean shot to the top of Fisher’s head. The fighters took opportunities thereafter, the bout intensifying as a left hook to the body landed for Allen and a right hook to the head landed for Fisher.

The gruelling bout ultimately ended in round five, with a ferocious left hook sealing victory for Allen, who was left hungry for a win after the nature of his defeat in Saudi Arabia. Fisher could just not find his feet after the swift first knockdown in the fifth, and the second knockdown – on the bell, as the towel came in – proved decisive. With that, the result was not so controversial this time around. Allen refrained from celebrating, despite breaking his opponent’s unbeaten record, as paramedics immediately entered the ring to check on Fisher. Fisher was thankfully fine after some minutes, and the friends shared an embrace as the arena waited for Allen to receive his first title: the WBA Intercontinental heavyweight belt.

Read our Privacy notice Jasmine Paolini became the first home winner of the Italian Open for 40 years with a dominant victory over Coco Gauff. The 29-year-old, who reached the final of the French Open and Wimbledon last year in a breakthrough season, delighted the fans at the Foro Italico with a 6-4 6-2 success. No Italian had won one of the two singles titles in Rome since Raffaella Reggi back in 1985 but Paolini thoroughly merited her triumph, while Jannik Sinner could make it a home double when he faces Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday. Paolini came out firing and edged a tight first set before running away with the second amid a slew of Gauff errors. By winning the title, Paolini guaranteed she will overtake Iga Swiatek to become world number four on Monday and therefore obtain a top-four seeding for the French Open, which begins next weekend. Gauff has returned to form on the European clay after a difficult few months but has finished runner-up in both the major events, with this loss following one against Aryna Sabalenka in Madrid a fortnight ago. Katie Boulter, meanwhile, reached the first clay-court final of her career at the Trophee Clarins in Paris.

CNN,Business,Trump tells Walmart to ‘eat the tariffs’ as retailer expects prices to increase,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/business/walmart-product-prices-tariffs,"President Donald Trump on Saturday said Walmart needs to stop “trying to blame tariffs” after the retail giant announced its products would become more expensive. Walmart’s CEO said the price increases were a result of Trump’s tariffs being “too high,” particularly when it came to Chinese goods. “We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said Thursday in an earnings call. Trump responded on Saturday, posting to Truth Social that “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!” Trump’s comments echoed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s comments Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that “businesses and the countries primarily eat the tariff.” Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called such theories “ludicrous.” Economists have told CNN that the tariffs will burden lower- and middle-income Americans, who have historically been Walmart’s primary customer base. And consumers often go to the retail giant for non-negotiable purchases, such as groceries. “We have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won’t stop. We’ll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,” Walmart told CNN in a statement Saturday. Price changes at Walmart will likely take effect by the end of May and prices will increase “much more” in June, the company’s finance chief, John David Rainey, told CNBC. Walmart, which has over 4,600 stores in the United States, gets merchandise from Canada, China, India, Mexico and Vietnam, among other nations. Those countries face at least 10% in tariffs, and imports of steel, aluminum, cars and auto parts face 25% tariffs. “All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact,” McMillon said.

Walmart warns it will raise prices because of tariffs Trump increased tariffs on most Chinese goods to a whopping 145%, but that rate dropped to 30% on Monday as part of a 90-day truce with China. But Trump said the tariffs could become “substantially higher” if a trade agreement with China is not reached. Other countries are negotiating with the United States amid a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. Baseline tariffs will not go lower than 10% during negotiations, Lutnick told CNN on Sunday. Trump’s trade war has sunk consumer sentiment in recent months. The University of Michigan reported that consumer sentiment fell 2.7% between April and May — a near-record low, in part due to Americans fearing a recession. Here’s what is expected to get more expensive at Walmart. “Food inflation is very much on our mind,” McMillon said. Bananas, avocados and coffee are among some of the groceries that McMillon said come from Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru. America also imports beets, cabbage, melons, and pineapples from Costa Rica. Sweet potatoes and citrus are imported from Peru. Walmart did not say how much prices could increase on fruits and vegetables. “We’ll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible,” McMillon said, suggesting that “controlling the amount of fresh food waste” could help. Between February and April, the average price of bananas per pound has increased by about 2 cents at US retailers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Ryan Monarch, assistant professor of economics at Syracuse University, told CNN that seasonal and holiday shopping purchases can’t be delayed for two to three months to wait on the trade war to play out. Walmart is currently focused on back-to-school shopping, according to McMillon. He explained that tariffs are paid as soon as a product enters the country through customs, meaning the higher tariffs are already affecting shipments. “So I think what we’re looking at is upward pressure that began in April and plays through the entire year on things that are imported,” McMillon said. Estimating tariff costs and order quantities could “get more challenging” further down the line when making “decisions related to things like Halloween and Christmas,” he said. “China, in particular, represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys,” McMillon said. Roughly 80% of toys sold in the United States are made in China, according to the Toy Association, an industry group. Toy companies, like Hasbro, the owner of Nerf and Play-doh, said some items will be cut from its portfolio, and Barbie creator Mattel has issued warnings about potential price hikes due to tariffs. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,” Trump said earlier this month, acknowledging the potential impact tariffs will have on toys. Related article
Trump’s trade war is about to change the way you shop There has already been a jump in the price of toys. Product pricing analysis from research firm Telsey Advisory Groups showed that the price of a Barbie doll with a swimsuit sold at Walmart’s competitor Target rose 42.9% over a week in mid-April to $14.99. Gaming products should also see big price hikes. Initially priced at $450, Nintendo’s Switch 2 could instead cost around $600, according to experts. Even an Apple iPhone 17 could cost more than $1,000 instead of $799, according to Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at investment firm Synovus. Childcare products, such as strollers, clothes, car seats and formula, could also see a price hike. Industry experts estimate that about 90% of children’s and baby gear products are manufactured exclusively in China, and that won’t change anytime soon. “Customers need those things. Even if they were to raise prices on those products, customers are still going to buy them,” Syracuse University’s Monarch said. “So you might expect products like that to see prices increasing pretty quickly.” In 2024, China sent more than $438 billion worth of goods into American homes. Nearly 19% of that total was machinery and mechanical appliances, according to data from the US International Trade Commission. Meanwhile, 4% of last year’s imports from China were bedding, furniture and lighting. Rainey, Walmart’s CFO, said general merchandise sales in the United States declined slightly during the first quarter, “with softness in electronics, home products and sporting goods.” Because home goods are not considered necessities like groceries and baby gear, consumers are more likely to hold off on buying them. “Consumers are very worried, and what they’re doing is they’re delaying their purchases of durable goods — things like cars, things like appliances,” said Monarch. Monarch added that Walmart was among companies to increase imports before tariffs took effect, allowing them to stock up on products that won’t perish.

CNN,Business,Edward Berthelot/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/business/labubu-doll-china-tariffs,"Naomi Lin’s favorite high-end accessory is wildly popular, an acquired taste, and shockingly resilient in the face of a tariff onslaught. No, it’s not Manolos or the latest offering from Prada — it’s a gremlin-like plush. It’s a Labubu, a palm-sized Nordic elf with bright eyes, sharp teeth and puckish grin. Lin, a medical student in Nebraska, owns dozens — and the one attached to her Chanel bag is dressed to the nines in a tweed outfit, matching headband and a mini “Chanel” purse. And Lin isn’t the only one captivated by Labubus’ ugly charm. Labubus are cute in the sense that they’re soft, miniature and come in a range of costumes you’d dress your baby in — a jack-o-lantern for Halloween, or a tiny pair of denim overalls. But they have glowering eyes and a jagged, sharp-toothed smile from ear to ear, an unblinking stare that would terrify anyone who caught its gaze in the middle of the night. The impish yet cute plushies are a global sensation among Gen Z and even those older, often hanging on handbags, backpacks and belt loops. People are flocking to shopping malls and waiting hours to purchase Labubus and their fellow creatures, who first appeared in “The Monsters” storybooks in 2015, in mystery “blind boxes,” meaning the buyer doesn’t know which one they’re getting in a given collection. The plushies’ distributor, China-based toy company Pop Mart, is enjoying meteoric growth both in the mainland and abroad in the US: In 2024, Labubus generated 3 billion yuan ($410 million) of Pop Mart’s 13.04 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in revenue. Labubus and other figurines distributed by the company have so far proven resistant to the tepid consumer sentiment in the US and the chaotic trade war between Washington and Beijing — and that growth hasn’t slowed. But it’s not just the size of the company’s sales, it’s their growth rate that’s more impressive. Pop Mart’s revenue outside China skyrocketed 375.2% to 5.07 billion yuan ($703 million) in 2024, and Citigroup research estimated Pop Mart’s revenue in America grew between 895% to 900% last year. Offline, Pop Mart’s brick-and-mortar stores from Los Angeles to Paris to Bangkok have infamously long lines, especially when new products are released. The growth is also fueled by a plethora of other figurines — there’s Baby Molly, Crybaby, Dimoo, Pucky and at least 30 more on the company’s US website. If you’re lucky enough to snag a Labubu, they can cost up to $85. Resellers on StockX are upcharging into the hundreds of dollars. And their fans are willing to splurge. Lin shelled out hundreds and spent hours on a TikTok Live to secure a Zimomo, a 22-inch creature with a spiked tail. “It’s in high demand, so it would be on par with a luxury item,” Lin said. Lin is not the only member of her family who is Pop Mart-obsessed. Her father, who bought Lin and her sister their first Labubus while visiting Taiwan, has a Crybaby plush on his suitcase. The meteoric growth of Pop Mart speaks to a larger history of Americans being attached to cute things from Asia (remember Hello Kitty?), Anne Cheng, an English professor at Princeton University, told CNN. Despite the push toward US-made products and the proliferation of anti-Asian sentiment during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growth trajectory for these toys just keeps going. Cheng said there’s always been hypocrisy in the US, where Asian people have faced bigoted stereotypes, but when the products they make “come in little boxable, consumable small bits, then they’re accessible.” Related article
A massive Trump tariff still exists on some of China’s cheapest exports The little gremlins, baby and creature keychains also offer a glimpse into luxury that is more attainable for most consumers. Celebrities have played a big role in making them a status symbol. K-pop megastar Lisa told Vanity Fair she got into blind boxes in early 2024 and “spent all my money” while jet-setting to different Pop Mart locations around the world. Oh, and Rihanna has a Labubu too. Some Labubu collections are certainly reminiscent of past crazes. But compared to luxurious collectibles, like say, designer bags or watches, toys that cost an average of $20 to $40 are not as expensive, and in uncertain times, people are looking for affordable indulgences. People are “looking for a fix and looking for anything to bring them joy,” said Ali Domrongchai, a food editor in New York City who just received her first Labubu as a gift this past year. Blind boxes are nothing new. The idea of buying something without knowing precisely what the package contains has driven many a craze, from baseball cards to video games. And the toy collective fanatics echo the Beanie Baby mania of the ’90s, or what it felt like checking which McDonald’s Happy Meal you got. Consumers who spoke to CNN all compared the immediate joy of opening a blind box to the high of gambling. China was so concerned about addiction that in 2023, it introduced strict regulation banning the sale of mystery boxes to children under 8 years old and requiring guardian consent for children who are older. “It plays into your desire for collecting things, then you keep buying them,” Cheng said. Pop Mart, like the majority of the toy industry, will almost certainly be impacted by President Donald Trump’s trade war with China. The US and China reached a 90-day truce this month, when the US lowered its 145% tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30%, and China reduced its 125% retaliatory tariffs to 10%. Related article
Labubu: The ‘kind of ugly’ plush toy that has taken the world by storm On its FAQ page, Pop Mart said that it will cover tariff-induced costs and that “customers will not be required to pay any additional customs fees.” But its latest release in April, a tie-dyed line of pastel-colored Labubus, cost $27.99 – $6 more than the previous one. CNN has reached out to Pop Mart for more details on how it plans to cover those tariff fees. Citigroup said it expects the company to accelerate diversifying its supply chain and raise prices in the US market, or prioritize expanding in other countries. In the meantime, Pop Mart’s stock, listed in Hong Kong, has been outperforming Tencent and Alibaba since the year began. For those who can’t get their hands on a real Labubu, there are knock-offs — often called lafufus or fauxbubus — but they’ll often have lower-quality fur or a slightly misshapen smile. And blind boxes aren’t exclusive to Pop Mart. Cute, kitschy items are a staple of East Asian culture, and Asian discount stores like Miniso and Daiso, which combined have hundreds of locations in the US, sell highly coveted blind box toys for under $5. And the bigger the market gets, the more likely it is that competitors will arise in China, the Citigroup analysts warned. And Lin’s Labubu, for the record, is not decked out in real Chanel. The toy’s outfit is from AliExpress, a source of cheap accessories for many Labubu fans. Domrongchai, the food editor in New York City, has been tuned into the hype: Her octogenarian great aunts have Labubus attached to their Louis Vuitton purses. And on a trip to visit family in Thailand last year, she visited “almost every mall in Bangkok” with her younger cousin to scour for the famous plush. But it was nowhere to be found, and $40 dollars for a toy is “an ungodly amount” for Thailand. Even for those who have managed to avoid the pull of the devilish smirk of a Labubu, there’s always a growing fan base attempting to turn them to the dark side. When a CNN reporter, a self proclaimed Sanrio and Miffy fan, confessed she found the monsters more unsettling than cute, Domrongchai was quick to encourage her: “They’re not that scary. They’re silly guys. Look, you need to spend some time with them.”",2025-05-18
CNN,Business,J. David Ake/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/moody-us-credit,"Moody’s Ratings downgraded the United States’ debt on Friday, stripping the country of its last perfect credit rating. The move could rattle financial markets and push up interest rates, potentially creating an additional financial burden for Americans already struggling with tariffs and inflation. Of the three major credit rating agencies, Moody’s was the lone holdout, maintaining its outstanding rating of AAA for US debt. Moody’s held a perfect credit rating for the United States since 1917. It now ranks US creditworthiness one notch below that, at Aa1, joining Fitch Ratings and S&P, which lowered their credit ratings for US debt in 2023 and 2011, respectively. The decision to downgrade debt was influenced by “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” Moody’s said in a statement. Moving forward, Moody’s said it expects borrowing needs to continue to grow and for it to weigh on the US economy as a whole. “The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden’s mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said on Friday. “If Moody’s had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.” A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to CNN. Moody’s initially put the United States on notice for a potential downgrade in November, at the time citing recent events that exemplified America’s extraordinary political divide. That included America’s near-default last summer and the resulting ouster of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the first time in history a speaker was given the boot during a legislative session, and Congress’ inability to cement a replacement for weeks. Moody’s said the US is is no immediate danger of being downgraded again: The credit-rating agency considers the US outlook “stable” in part because of “its long history of very effective monetary policy led by an independent Federal Reserve.” President Donald Trump, however, has recently raised questions of whether he’d continue to respect the central bank’s independence, and has previously threatened to fire Chair Jerome Powell. Aa1 is still quite strong, despite its notch below perfect. The ratings agency noted that America’s system of governance, albeit challenged, gives Moody’s confidence that the United States still deserves a near-perfect, if not AAA, credit rating. “The stable outlook also takes into account institutional features, including the constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of government that contributes to policy effectiveness over time and is relatively insensitive to events over a short period. While these institutional arrangements can be tested at times, we expect them to remain strong and resilient,” Moody’s said. The credit-rating agency said that increasing government revenue or reducing spending could restore America’s AAA rating. Trump has taken aim at the latter through the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, resulting in thousands of federal government workers being laid off and the gutting of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). However, it’s unclear that such moves are changing the government’s borrowing needs. Already, the country is approaching a summer deadline for when the US could default on its debt unless the borrowing limit is raised, according to Treasury Department estimates. At the same time, Trump is pushing Congress to pass his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The package would cut taxes deeply – essentially making permanent the sweeping individual income tax provisions of Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as adding several temporary tax breaks to fulfill the president’s campaign promises. It also calls for historic cuts to the nation’s safety net – particularly Medicaid and food stamps – in an effort to cut spending. But the tax revenue loss would still swamp the spending reductions. The package would add $3.3 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next decade, according to a preliminary estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Annual deficits would jump from $1.8 trillion in 2024 to $2.9 trillion by 2034 as the federal government would continue to spend more than it would raise in revenue, the committee projected. Ballooning deficits, the unique US debt ceiling mechanism and political intransigence have been at the center of its downgrades from all three major credit ratings agencies. In 2011, S&P cited “political brinksmanship” and “America’s governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable.” In 2023, Fitch warned of the United States’ “fiscal deterioration,” its “high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance.” America was running a $1.3 trillion annual budget deficit in 2011, a number that has since risen to $1.8 trillion last year. Still, the Obama and Biden administrations lambasted both of those decisions. In 2023, Yellen said the decision was “arbitrary and based on outdated data.” US debt has long been considered by investors as the safest of safe havens, but Moody’s downgrade, along with Fitch’s and S&P’s suggests it has lost some of its luster. A downgrade would likely cause US Treasury yields to rise as investors see more risk in lending money to the government. US Treasuries – and particularly the 10-year US Treasury – influence all kinds of debt, from the mortgage rate for the houses Americans buy to contracts written around the world This is a developing story and will be updated.",2025-05-18
CNN,Business,Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Shutterstock,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/business/a-rogue-employee-was-behind-groks-unprompted-white-genocide-mentions,"Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company on Friday said a “rogue employee” was behind its chatbot’s unsolicited rants about “white genocide” in South Africa earlier this week. The clarification comes less than 48 hours after Grok — the chatbot from Musk’s xAI that is available through his social media platform, X — began bombarding users with unfounded genocidal theories in response to queries about completely off-topic subjects. In an X post, the company said the “unauthorized modification” in the extremely early morning hours Pacific time pushed the AI-imbued chatbot to “provide a specific response on a political topic” that violates xAI’s policies. The company did not identify the employee. “We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok’s transparency and reliability,” the company said in the post. To do so, xAI says it will openly publish Grok’s system prompts on GitHub to ensure more transparency. Additionally, the company says it will install “checks and measures” to make sure xAI employees can’t alter prompts without preliminary review. And the AI company will also have a monitoring team in place 24/7 to address issues that aren’t tackled by the automated systems. Nicolas Miailhe, co-founder and chief executive of PRISM Eval — an AI testing and evaluation start-up — told CNN that X’s proposed remedy is a mixed bag.”More transparency is generally better on this given the nature of the bot and platform (media),” Miailhe said. “Though detailed info about the system prompting can also be used by malicious actors to craft prompt injection attacks.” Musk, who owns xAI and currently serves as a top White House adviser, was born and raised in South Africa and has a history of arguing that a “white genocide” was committed in the nation. The billionaire media mogul has also claimed that white farmers in the country are being discriminated against under land reform policies that the South African government says are aimed at combating apartheid fallout. Less than a week ago, the Trump administration allowed 59 white South Africans to enter the US as refugees, claiming they’d been discriminated against, while simultaneously also suspending all other refugee resettlement. Per a Grok response to xAI’s own post, the “white genocide” responses occurred after a “rogue employee at xAI tweaked my prompts without permission on May 14,” allowing the AI chatbot to “spit out a canned political response that went against xAI’s values.” Notably, the chatbot declined to take ownership over its actions, saying, “I didn’t do anything — I was just following the script I was given, like a good AI!” While it’s true that chatbots’ responses are predicated on approved text responses anchored to their code, the dismissive admission emphasizes the danger of AI, both in terms of disseminating harmful information but also in playing down its part in such incidents. When CNN asked Grok why it had shared answers about “white genocide,” the AI chatbot again pointed to the rogue employee, adding that “my responses may have been influenced by recent discussions on X or data I was trained on, but I should have stayed on topic.” Over two years have passed since OpenAI’s ChatGPT made its splashy debut, opening the floodgates on commercially available AI chatbots. Since then, a litany of other AI chatbots — including Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Perplexity, Mistral’s Le Chat, and DeepSeek — have become available to US adults. A recent Gallup poll shows that most Americans are using multiple AI-enabled products weekly, regardless of whether they’re aware of the fact. But another recent study, this one from the Pew Research Center, shows that only “one-third of U.S. adults say they have ever used an AI chatbot,” while 59% of US adults don’t think they have much control over AI in their lives. CNN asked xAI whether the “rogue employee” has been suspended or terminated, as well as whether the company plans to reveal the employee’s identity. The company did not respond at the time of publication.",2025-05-18

CNN,Politics,"Getty Images, Reuters",https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/trump-putin-ukraine-zelensky-talks,"Donald Trump will speak on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the Ukraine war, the US president announced. “THE SUBJECTS OF THE CALL WILL BE, STOPPING THE ‘BLOODBATH’ THAT IS KILLING, ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 5000 RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS A WEEK, AND TRADE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. The announcement comes after representatives from Ukraine and Russia held face-to-face talks in Turkey on Friday. It was the first time the two countries held direct talks at any level in three years. Trump has previously said he doesn’t think there will be a significant breakthrough on peace talks until he and Putin speak directly. “I don’t believe anything is going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,” Trump told reporters earlier this week. Trump said he plans to speak with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and various members of NATO after he talks with Putin. Related article
Russian attack on bus in Sumy region kills nine, Ukraine says, hours after peace talks “HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump wrote Saturday. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Saturday that preparations are underway for a phone conversation between Putin and Trump. “The conversation is being prepared,” Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS without providing further details. Ukraine, its allies in Europe and the US had pressured Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Putin denied that request and instead called for direct talks in Turkey between the nations, which Trump firmly urged Zelensky to accept. Zelensky, however, said he would go only if Putin showed up. The Russians sent a delegation that Zelensky deemed “low level,” and Putin did not show up for talks. Ukraine ultimately sent a delegation too, which led to the nations’ first talks since 2022, resulting in an agreement on swapping 1,000 prisoners. Trump told reporters while traveling in the Middle East earlier this week he didn’t expect Putin to show up to the talks in Turkey if he wasn’t there. “Look, nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK? And obviously he wasn’t going to go. He was gonna go, but he thought I was gonna go. He wasn’t going if I wasn’t there,” Trump said aboard Air Force One. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke Saturday to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stressing the US’ commitment to ending the conflict, according to State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. analysis
A whiplash week of diplomacy leaves Ukraine much where it started “Secretary Rubio welcomed the prisoner exchange agreement reached during the May 16 Ukraine-Russia talks in Istanbul and delivered President Trump’s strong message: the United States is committed to achieving a lasting end to the Russia-Ukraine war,” Bruce said in a statement. “The comprehensive peace plan proposed by the United States outlines the best way forward. The Secretary emphasized President Trump’s call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the violence.” After the call with Lavrov, Rubio posted on X, “The U.S. has presented a strong peace plan and we welcome the Prisoner of War exchange agreement reached in Istanbul. Let’s not miss this huge opportunity. The time for ending this war is now.” In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump said he is “tired” of other people negotiating the war and stressed how he and Putin need to meet. “He is at the table, and he wanted this meeting. And I always felt there can’t be a meeting without me, because I don’t think a deal is going to get through,” Trump said. “We have to get together, and I think we’ll probably schedule it, because I’m tired of having other people go and meet and everything else.” Trump was reluctant to cast the Russian president as the obstacle to peace with Ukraine, but he also told Fox News he thinks “Putin is tired of this whole thing.” “He’s not looking good, and he wants to look good,” Trump said. “Don’t forget, this was supposed to end in one week.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

CNN,Politics,Former FBI Director James Comey interviewed by the US Secret Service,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/politics/comey-interviewed-secret-service,"Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by US Secret Service agents at their Washington, DC, field office on Friday afternoon, according to law enforcement sources. Comey was interviewed by agents investigating a photo he posted to social media Thursday showing shells in the sand on a beach spelling out “86 47,” which has become a popular social media code for removing Trump from the presidency. Related article
Prosecuting James Comey for social media posts may be fruitless, legal and security experts say Comey was not in custody and appeared voluntarily, a source said. Comey told the Secret Service he and his wife were walking on the beach on Thursday when he saw the arranged shells, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said. Comey said they thought it was an address for a nearby property, but when he realized it was likely someone making a political statement, he snapped a photo and posted it, according to the source. Comey told the agents that a family member told him the post could possibly be interpreted as something sinister, so he deleted it, but he said he didn’t know “86” could mean violence and had no intention of threatening or harming Trump. Trump and fellow Republicans have attacked Comey for the post, demanding an investigation. Comey “knew exactly what that meant,” Trump said in a Fox News interview released Friday. “A child knows what that meant. If you’re the FBI director and you don’t know what that meant, that meant assassination.” In explaining why he removed the post, Comey wrote on Instagram that he had “posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message.” It was expected that Comey would be asked whether he intended the message as a threat, or to inspire others who might consider an act of violence against Trump, the first law enforcement source said. The law enforcement source close familiar with the case told CNN that Attorney General Pam Bondi told the Secret Service operations center Thursday night the case had to be presented to the US attorney first thing Friday before the scheduled interview. Ultimately, a decision on whether the case is chargeable as a threat against the president may lie with the US attorney in Washington. “The Secret Service vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees,” Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN. “We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.” Legally speaking, prosecuting Comey may be fruitless as any legal action would stand little chance, especially after a recent Supreme Court decision regarding threats and among a judiciary that has expanded free speech rights in recent years, legal experts say. “I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence,” Comey said Thursday of the number “86,” which can refer to something being tossed away or taken out. The corresponding “47” matches Trump’s current term in office as the 47th president. “It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.” A Secret Service source familiar with the investigation told CNN that under normal circumstances, such a post wouldn’t warrant a full-fledged investigation but under the current political climate will likely get more attention. Such an investigation, the source said, would serve as a distraction for agents in an organization already stretched thin. Another law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN the case is a “waste of our time. We’re strapped for resources but we’re investigating seashells.” This story has been updated with additional details.",2025-05-18
CNN,Politics,Nonprofit leaders brace for possible targeting by the Trump administration after tax measure advances in Congress,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/nonprofit-leaders-say-they-are-bracing-for-potential-targeting-by-the-trump-administration-after-a-controversial-tax-measure-advances-in-congress,"A House measure that would make it easier to yank the tax-exempt status of nonprofits the Trump administration deems as supporting terrorism marks the latest effort by the president and his Republican allies to hobble organizations that oppose his agenda, some nonprofit leaders argue. The provision comes as President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office in extraordinary ways to target top law firms, elite universities and other perceived political enemies. Last month, for instance, Trump directed his Justice Department to launch a probe of ActBlue, the main fundraising platform for Democratic candidates and liberal causes. The language – added this week by the House’s tax-writing committee to the massive “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that’s a top priority for Trump – would allow the Treasury secretary to suspend the tax-exempt status of organizations the administration says are “terrorist supporting.” More than 200 groups – ranging from the American Library Association to the Sierra Club – recently signed onto a public statement urging the House to remove the provision. They say it’s a tool for the president to take aim at his opponents. “We have seen this administration use every lever of power they have been able to grab to target the people they see as their enemies,” said Cole Leiter, executive director of Americans Against Government Censorship, one of the groups objecting to the House language. “This is a broad-based weaponization of government, and this is only the latest manifestation of that.” Nonprofit groups fear more is on the way – with a White House deadline looming for government agencies to identify large publicly traded corporations, foundations and nonprofits, universities and state and local bar and medical associations for potential civil investigations. In a statement, a White House official contended that Trump is operating within his rights and the law. “President Trump will always stand for law and order, ending the weaponization of the legal system, and rooting out fraud in the federal government,” said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields in an email to CNN, echoing the president’s familiar refrain that the Biden administration used the judicial system against him when Trump was out of office. “Every action he has taken in his second term reflects these priorities and is authorized by the Constitution,” Fields said. “Outside groups that ignored the previous administration’s egregious legal abuses against President Trump have no credibility today.” The tax provision, recently added to a nearly 400-page legislative proposal by the GOP-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, hews closely to language in a bill written by New York Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney that the House approved in the last Congressional session but did not pass the Senate. It would allow the Treasury secretary to suspend the tax-exempt status of charities the secretary determines have provided “material support or resources” to an organization the government has designated as a terrorist organization. Aides to Tenney and Ways and Means Chair Missouri Rep. Jason Smith did not respond to CNN’s inquiries about the measure. During floor debate on the Tenney bill last November, Smith said lawmakers have a “duty to make sure that taxpayers are not subsidizing terrorism.” Groups opposing the measure said it lacks adequate safeguards to protect organizations’ due-process rights. Kia Hamadanchy, a senior policy counsel with the ACLU, noted that it already is illegal to provide material support to a terrorist organization. The new provision, Hamadanchy said, is problematic because gives the Treasury secretary exclusive discretion to designate a group as terrorist-supporting and would allow the agency to suspend a nonprofit’s tax-exempt status “before you’ve had a chance to go before a neutral decision maker like a judge.” Lisa Gilbert – the co-president of the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen – said she fears organizations with international networks could unwittingly become ensnared should the provision become law. “Think about foreign humanitarian aid, for example, or groups that receive funds from foundations that are not solely based in the United States,” he said. “There is a lot of activity that could be swept up.” The White House referred questions about the bill’s language to the Treasury Department. A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment. Related video
GOP hardliner trashes Trump’s agenda bill The overall bill currently faces a rocky path in the House, although the chamber’s Republican leaders have said they want to bring it to the floor for a vote next week. A group of GOP hardliners on Friday blocked its passage in a key committee as they demanded steeper cuts and changes to its Medicaid provisions. If the bill passes the House, organizations opposed to the language regarding nonprofits’ tax status say they will fight to kill it in the Senate. The legislation deals with a range of the president’s priorities, from tax cuts to immigration enforcement. But to pass it through Congress, where Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers, GOP leaders are relying on a tool called budget reconciliation – allowing a simple majority to approve it without any Democratic votes. Under strict Senate rules, however, the chamber’s parliamentarian must determine whether its provisions have an actual impact on the budget, not merely an “incidental” one. An early analysis by a congressional joint taxation panel found the provision has a “negligible” effect in revenue, buoying opponents’ hopes that it could be stripped from the larger bill in the Senate. Federal law bars the president from ordering tax investigations of specific people or organizations, but Trump has publicly threatened to revoke the tax-exempt status of Harvard University for refusing to accede to his policy demands. In remarks last month about Harvard’s tax status, Trump indicated other organizations could be targeted, and singled out Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a nonprofit watchdog group that tackles public corruption and has sued the Trump administration over several of its actions. Some nonprofit leaders now are warily watching for other potential administration moves, arising from executive order that Trump signed January 21, aimed at encouraging the private sector to end what the administration deems as “illegal discrimination.” Among other things, the order directed agencies to identify up to nine potential targets among foundations, corporations, colleges and other entities, for “civil compliance” probes as part of the administration’s effort to root out diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility policies. Groups that could be subjected to scrutiny include what the order calls “large” nonprofits and associations, foundations with assets of at least $500 million and colleges and universities with endowments that top $1 billion. Attorney General Pam Bondi already has directed the department’s Civil Rights Division to review whether universities are trying to skirt a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that said schools could no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis for granting admission. A Justice Department task force aimed at combatting antisemitism on campuses is also investigating nearly a dozen universities and the entire University of California system. Trump’s Jan. 21 order also calls on the attorney general to issue a report to the White House recommending actions within 120 days – a deadline that will arrive next week. But it’s not clear whether lists of potential targets have been assembled or will be released publicly. A DOJ spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry about the report. Even so, leaders of nonprofit groups are having conversations with their lawyers and looking for ways to avoid risks and prepare for potential audits, several people familiar with internal discussions tell CNN. “People are trying to brace for it,” said Gilbert of Public Citizen. “It’s very unclear what it will mean to be on a list in Trump’s America.” CNN’s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.",2025-05-18
CNN,Politics,Device that makes semi-automatic rifles fire quicker allowed by Trump administration,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/device-allows-rifles-fire-quicker,"President Donald Trump’s administration agreed on Friday to permit the sale of a device that allows for semi-automatic rifles to be fired quicker, a decision that gun control activists say paves the way for more mass shootings. The Department of Justice announced the agreement as part of a settlement between the federal government and gun manufacturer Rare Breed Triggers, in litigation brought by the Biden administration. “This Department of Justice believes that the 2nd Amendment is not a second-class right,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in the statement. “And we are glad to end a needless cycle of litigation with a settlement that will enhance public safety.” Forced-reset triggers (FRT) allow a semi-automatic rifle to be fired at an increased rate by automatically resetting the trigger after each shot. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) classified them as illegal machine guns in 2022 under the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934. Machine guns have been heavily regulated by Congress since the NFA was passed, and the manufacture for civilian use was banned completely under the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986, a bill endorsed by the National Rifle Association.

Children and teens are more likely to die by guns than anything else The Justice Department brought a lawsuit in New York in 2023 against Rare Breed Triggers, which made and distributed such devices, leading to a court ruling blocking it from selling them. While the case was pending, the National Association of Gun Rights (NAGR) filed a separate lawsuit in Texas challenging the ban and a judge there ruled the ban was unlawful. The latest settlement resolves those disputes and falls in line with Trump’s February executive order on protecting the Second Amendment’s “right to bear arms,” the Justice Department said in its statement. “This decision marks a new era of holding the DOJ and ATF accountable when they trample the rights of law-abiding gun owners,” NAGR President Dudley Brown said in a release. “We made them give back what they took, and that’s a precedent they’ll never forget.” The DOJ also said the settlement includes “agreed-upon conditions” concerning public safety with respect to FRTs, including that Rare Breed will not develop or design FRTs for use in any pistol and will enforce its patents. Rare Breed also agreed to promote the safe and responsible use of its products, the DOJ said. CNN has reached out to Rare Breed Triggers for comment on the settlement. Democratic lawmakers and gun control groups have widely condemned the decision. Vanessa Gonzalez, a Vice President with GIFFORDS, the national gun violence prevention group led by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, said in a statement the Trump administration “effectively legalized machine guns.” “This is an incredibly dangerous move that will enable shooters to inflict horrific damage,” Gonzalez said. “The only people who benefit from these being on the market are the people who will make money from selling them, everyone else will suffer the consequences.” The national gun control advocacy group, Brady United, said the settlement means “highly dangerous weapons of war can now be purchased anonymously” and without a background check. “The Trump’s Administration’s secret settlement with the gun lobby to permit the sale of Forced Reset Triggers will turn already deadly firearms into weapons of mass destruction,” President of Brady, Kris Brown, said in the statement. “(It) is not only an astonishing abuse of power, but undermines decades of sensible government gun safety policy and puts whole communities at immediate serious risk.”",2025-05-18
CNN,Politics,Social Security drops controversial anti-fraud review amid growing claims backlog,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/politics/social-security-anti-fraud-policy,"A month after instituting a controversial anti-fraud policy that sparked widespread concern among senior citizens, the Social Security Administration has quietly dropped a key piece of the measure. The agency will no longer hold retirement benefit applications for three days to check for fraud, according to an email sent to workers and reviewed by CNN. The decision comes as the backlog in retirement benefit claims has swelled to nearly 575,000 applications, and employees, whose ranks have thinned from downsizing efforts, are being encouraged to work harder to process those claims. Pushed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, the anti-fraud policy was revised several times before being implemented amid an outcry from advocates for senior citizens and people with disabilities. Originally, the agency wanted to bar applicants from filing for benefits over the telephone, arguing that it could not do sufficient identity verification. Instead, people would have had to confirm their identities through their online “my Social Security” account or visit a field office to complete the claim in person. Advocates feared that the policy would make it harder for many folks to file for claims, particularly if they are not computer-savvy or live far from the agency’s offices. The policy change, along with a related one ending beneficiaries’ ability to update their direct deposit information over the phone, prompted senior citizens and people with disabilities to flood the agency’s phone lines and field offices with concerns. Many thought they had to prove their identities to continue receiving payments or had questions about the new procedures. Related article
Are changes at the Social Security Administration concerning you? Share your story with us Less than two weeks later, Social Security announced that the anti-fraud policy would only apply to those filing for retirement, survivors or family benefits over the phone, and its rollout would be delayed by two weeks to April 14. The phone claims would be subject to a fraud review, and if irregularities were detected, applicants would have to go to a field office to prove their identity. Asked about the latest change in policy, a Social Security spokesperson said the agency “continues to refine the anti-fraud algorithm to flag only the claims with the highest probability of fraud. Continuous improvements will ensure timely processing of claims while protecting beneficiaries from fraud.” However, the review process only found two cases – out of more than 110,000 claims – that had a high probability of being fraudulent, according to an internal document obtained by Nextgov/FCW, which covers technology in federal agencies. Fewer than 1% of claims were flagged as potentially fraudulent. What’s more, the anti-fraud checks delayed the processing of retirement claims by 25% and led to worse customer service, according to the May document. “It created a problem in customer service where one didn’t exist, and it didn’t do anything to prevent fraud,” said Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who worked at the agency during the Biden administration. As of mid-May, Social Security had nearly 575,000 pending retirement claims, with about 140,000 of them languishing for at least 60 days, according to an email from Stephen Evangelista, Social Security’s deputy commissioner for operations, that was sent to employees and viewed by CNN. He noted that the agency is receiving a record number of claims this year for several reasons, including the peak wave of Baby Boomers hitting retirement age and a law passed by Congress that beefed up Social Security benefits for nearly 3 million federal, state and local workers. The backlog began increasing swiftly last fall, shooting up from fewer than 350,000 pending claims in September to nearly 600,000 pending claims in April, according to Social Security data posted online. Evangelista urged workers in the field offices and another unit to “do their very best” to increase the number of retirement claims they clear every day by at least 10% for the rest of May. “I am calling for a sprint – a focused, concerted effort in all offices beginning today and lasting through the end of May – to address this growing backlog of pending retirement and survivor claims,” he wrote. The missive did not go over well with many employees, said Joel Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3184, which represents workers in nearly 100 agency offices across the South and Southwest. Social Security is in the midst of culling about 7,000 workers, or roughly 12%, from its staff – offering two rounds of deferred resignation offers, as well as other buyout and early retirement incentives. Multiple field offices have lost sizeable shares of their staff. And while the agency is reassigning about 1,000 employees from headquarters and regional offices to work in field offices and other mission-critical units, it will take time to train them. “Employees find it to be another sign of disrespect from an out-of-touch agency leadership,” Smith said of the directive. Workers “weren’t looking for another demotivational email from an agency leadership that cut their telework, encouraged them to quit and created an unnecessary backlog.”",2025-05-18
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,A24,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/entertainment/eddington-pedro-pascal-cannes-film-festival,"Ari Aster is currently living in a state of blissful ignorance. It won’t last long. The director of “Midsommar” and “Beau Is Afraid,” who has brought his politically volatile work “Eddington” to the Cannes Film Festival, admits he hasn’t seen any of the online reactions to his movie. “I’ve been very deliberately avoiding the discourse about the film,” he told CNN during a packed and often impassioned press conference at the festival on Saturday. “I’ll probably dip my head into the swamp and see what the f***’s going on in there, or something, but I haven’t done it yet.” “Eddington,” starring Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler, is set in small-town New Mexico during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Phoenix’s sheriff is baffled by mask policies and the apparent hysteria among the townspeople, while Pascal’s mayor is toeing the line (while also making dubious business deals with big tech to build a data center on the town’s outskirts). Their contretemps predates the pandemic, rooted in their relationships with the sheriff’s wife, an aloof, clearly depressed Emma Stone. The small-town drama is pulled wider by news events, namely the death of George Floyd and the protests movement that followed. Aster shoehorns all manner of hot-button topics: identity politics, social media silos, false flag attacks, and the allure of conspiracy theories, all facilitated by the wholesale erosion of truth in the digital age. The film is proving a potent Rorschach test. Less than 24 hours after it premiered, there’s already plenty of online chatter about where “Eddington’s” own politics stand, with commentators of all stripes – some sight unseen – making the case it speaks for them. “I wanted to paint a picture of the society that we’re now living in,” said Aster. “And I didn’t want to attach myself to one ideology or one story or one belief system, because it’s too narrow. That’s not the point, y’know? The film is designed to be ambiguous in certain ways.” “What the film is about, for me, is about what happens when people who are so isolated and are living in their own realities – what happens when they come into conflict with each other,” Aster explained. “When you start bumping up against each other, a new logic is created, and out of that, people start amplifying each other’s fears.” Earlier at the press conference, the director discussed how the project began. “I wrote this film in a state of fear and anxiety about the world,” he said. “I wanted to try and pull back and just describe and show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore.” “I feel over the last 20 years we’ve fallen into this age of hyper-individualism … that social force that used to be kind of central to liberal mass democracies – which is an agreed upon version of the world – that is gone now,” he added. “Covid felt like the moment where that length was finally cut for good,” Aster said. “I wanted to make a film about just what America feels like to me and what it felt like to me at that time.” Journalists pressed the actors and director more than once on the current state of America. One questioned if actors had fears of reprisals for making movies with political messages. “Fear is the way that they win,” said Pascal. “So keep telling the stories, keep expressing yourself, and keep fighting to be who you are. And f—k the people that try to make you scared, y’know? And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so, in telling stories. And don’t let them win.” Pascal, answering another question about Latin American migrants, recounted his youth:“My parents are refugees for Chile. I myself was a refugee. We fled a dictatorship. And I was privileged enough to grow up in the US after asylum in Denmark. And if it weren’t for that, I don’t know what would have happened to us. And so I stand by those protections,always.” Another journalist went as far as to ask if there was “nothing left but civil war waiting for America.” “I don’t speak English,” Aster quipped, before eventually answering. “I think we’re on a dangerous road, and I feel like we’re living through an experiment that is going wrong – it’s gone wrong. It’s not going well and it feels like there’s no way out of it … (It) should probably be stopped or paused because it’s not working, but it’s clear that nobody’s actually interested in stopping it.” Related article
Robert De Niro hits out at Trump in Cannes speech Cannes is no stranger to mixing art of politics. The seminal 1968 edition featured protests spearheaded by director Jean-Luc Godard, which forced the festival to shut down. (Time proved kind to Godard of course, who will be venerated once more at Cannes this year with Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” which retraces the new wave director’s efforts to get 1960 film “À Bout de Souffle” made.) The 78th edition, the first since President Donald Trump’s return to office, has already, and perhaps inevitably, kept one eye on the news. On the opening night, Robert De Niro, receiving an honorary Palme d’Or, hit out Trump, labelling him a “philistine president.” “In my country, we are fighting like hell for the democracy we once took for granted,” he told an audience made up of the great and good of the international film community.

CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Eli Adé/Warner Bros.,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/entertainment/sinners-movie-black-america-cec,"White supremacy. Nope. Can’t use those words anymore. Racism? Old news. The racial reckoning took care of that years ago. Diversity, equity and… Hush. Now you about to get us in some serious trouble. It’s a tough time to talk about racism in America. The country is in the midst of a Woke Scare in which the mere mention of terms like “racism” or “diversity” invites retribution. Teachers have been fired, books banned and universities investigated for invoking those terms. The acronym DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) has become what the author George Saunders calls an “omni-pejorative,” an all-purpose slur that is “deliberately vague.” It’s no wonder that some Black commentators warn that America is entering a second “nadir,” a term used to describe a low point in race relations that began in the late 1800s and carried into the early 20th century. It was a time when blatant racism was common among White political leaders, and lynchings were routine. What can a person who cares about racial justice do to get heard in today’s grim racial climate? Make a vampire movie. That’s what filmmaker Ryan Coogler has done with “Sinners,” a horror movie that’s become a cultural phenomenon while earning more than $220 million at the domestic box office since its release last month. (The film is produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) “Sinners,” which follows Black twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who open a juke joint in rural Mississippi during the Great Depression, has earned a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praise the film’s blend of vampires and Black folklore, offering an array of explanations for its success. Black moviegoers have turned out in large numbers to see it. But there’s another, more frightening reason why “Sinners” is resonating — one that most critics have missed. Darkened movie theaters are among the few public spaces left in America where Black people feel free to vicariously express their horror over the recent, head-spinning changes to the country’s racial climate. Many successful films, TV series, songs and other entertainments mine the untapped emotions of their audiences. “Sinners” is no different. Consider two recent events that occurred soon after the film’s release in mid-April: In addition, two seismic developments have driven a stake into the heart of the 2025 racial justice movement. In his second term, President Trump, who has a history of making racist public statements, has waged war on DEI efforts within the government and in public schools and universities. And the Black Lives Matter movement has been neutered by questions over the organization’s financial transparency and allegations of corruption, along with the inevitable “Whitelash” that follows any racial progress in America. I’ve witnessed this despair myself. I have never seen such a widespread feeling of hopelessness among my Black friends and family. “Sinners” is set in the Mississippi Delta in 1932, but part of its appeal are its nods to today’s bleak racial landscape. There are clever references to colorism, mass incarceration and a White vampire who claims he’s a victim of reverse racism. In the film, every movement toward interracial unity is seen as a deadly trap. “We believe in equality,” says the film’s lead villain Remmick (Jack O’Connell), while flashing a vulpine grin to a group of skeptical Black juke joint patrons. “Can’t we be for one night family?” he asks. We can’t, Coogler’s movie implies. There’s not a single sympathetic White character in the film. That’s the movie’s unspoken message: White America sucks the life out of Black culture, dangling promises of equality that can never be. I watched “Sinners” in a theater filled with Black people. There I saw something I hadn’t seen since my father snuck me into theaters when I was a boy to watch 1970s “Blaxploitation” films like “Superfly” and “Blacula.” When a Black character in “Sinners” dispatched a racist White character at point-blank range in a particularly gruesome way, many people in the audience whooped and applauded. “We was never going to be free,” a Black character tells another near the end of the film, after their lofty plans fail. “Sinners” does offer plenty of Black Joy. There are scenes depicting the beauty and resilience of Black culture — the sweaty transcendence of our music; the West African spirituality that we blended with Christianity to make something new; the playfully raucous way Black folks talk to one another when White folks ain’t around. For 2 hours and 17 minutes, Black people and their allies can sit in a darkened theater and still believe that Black lives matter. They can escape into a story where Black characters affirm their anger and disenchantment — and not have to worry about getting fired, arrested or losing their funding. And yet this is one of the most frightening movies I’ve ever seen — not because of anything on screen, but because of its undercurrent of Black despair. “Nothing could be a more terrifying backdrop for a story involving creatures of the night than a world already determined to ignore your screams for help,” wrote critic Cuba Jimenez in an essay about the movie. That sentiment is the other monster that stalks the screen in “Sinners” — the kind of despair can’t be stopped by garlic or a crucifix. Screenings of “Sinners” may be one of the few public places left where Black Americans can freely express their emotions. And that’s more chilling than any drooling monster a filmmaker can conjure.

CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Mike Lawrie/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/entertainment/trump-springs-teen,"President Donald Trump had some words for The Boss. In a Friday morning Truth Social post, the president criticized Bruce Springsteen for “go[ing] to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States.” The president’s comments come days after Springsteen lambasted Trump during the first show of his latest tour with the E Street Band. Speaking at the Manchester-based concert on Wednesday, Springsteen branded the Trump administration “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous,” calling on “all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us.” “Raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring,” Springsteen said at the Mancunian show. The setlist was a marked departure from the band’s post-pandemic shows. While the last few years have seen Springsteen play a mostly autobiographical, introspective set devoid of the political statements that have been the hallmarks of his career, the performance on Wednesday — Springsteen’s first since Trump returned to the Oval Office — included several. A representative for Springsteen did not respond to a request for comment after Trump’s social media post. Trump’s Truth Social post also saw the president accuse Springsteen of “not (being) a talented guy,” an ironic allegation given Trump previously featured the rocker’s “Born in the U.S.A.” at multiple rallies without Springsteen’s consent. The post also slammed Springsteen for speaking out against the president while abroad rather than while on US soil. “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare,’” Trump wrote. “Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!” Springsteen has supported and campaigned for several Democratic candidates throughout his career.

The limited-run play’s penultimate performance from the Winter Garden Theatre in New York will air live on CNN and CNN International and stream on CNN.com at 7 p.m. ET. “This announcement marks a historic Broadway first: never before has a live play ever been televised,” the network said in a news release. The show is an adaptation of the 2005 movie Clooney directed of the same name and is based on veteran journalist Edward R. Murrow’s work and tension with Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare of the 1950s. The play, which debuted in March, swiftly shattered weekly records, becoming the highest-grossing play in Broadway history. It has also earned five Tony Award nominations, including Clooney for best leading actor in a play. “I can’t tell you how exciting it is to do something that’s never been done. CNN is the perfect place to bring this story of courage to so many more people than we could have ever hoped. Live TV. No net. Buckle up everyone,” Clooney said in the news release. Discussing the play in a previous interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Clooney stressed the importance of journalism in preserving democracy, citing the veteran journalist’s words. “It doesn’t matter what political bend you are on – when you hear things like, you know, ‘We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and a conviction depends on evidence and due process of law, and we will not walk in fear of one another. We won’t be driven by fear into an age of unreason,’ I think those are extraordinarily powerful words for who we are at our best,” Clooney said. The play comes at a time when the Trump administration has launched attacks on media, including barring the Associated Press from some of President Donald Trump’s events and attempting to end federal funding for NPR and PBS. Clooney – a major Democratic donor – has repeatedly spoken out against Trump. And ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraising for then-President Joe Biden before Biden’s disastrous performance at CNN’s presidential debate that ultimately led him to drop out of the race. According to a forthcoming book from Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, Biden did not recognize Clooney – whom he had known for years – at the fundraiser, leaving the actor “shaken to his core.” Less than a month after the interaction, Clooney released an op-ed calling for Biden to drop out of the race.",2025-05-18
CNN,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/16/entertainment/chris-brown-arrest-custody-uk-intl,"Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown’s upcoming tour was thrown into question Friday as a British judge ordered him held in custody while facing allegations that he beat a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023. Brown, 36, appeared in Manchester Magistrates’ Court to face one count of causing grievous bodily harm and was ordered held until his next hearing June 13 in London – the same day he’s due to take the stage in Frankfurt, Germany, on the third date of his world tour. Judge Joanne Hirst rejected Brown’s bail request after prosecutor Hannah Nicholls said that the crime was “extremely serious.” Brown was on tour in the UK in February 2023 when he is alleged to have attacked producer Abe Diaw with a bottle at the Tape nightclub, in London’s Mayfair neighborhood. Defense attorney Grace Forbes argued that the American performer wasn’t a flight risk and should be released. Brown was flanked by court officers in the dock. His hair was bleached blonde and he wore sweatpants and a black T-shirt. He confirmed his name and birth date, and said that his address was the local Lowry Hotel, where he was arrested early Thursday and taken into custody. His case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court in London, where he is expected to enter a plea to the charge. Brown’s representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as “Run It,” “Kiss Kiss” and “Without You.” He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for “F.A.M.E.” and then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for “11:11 (Deluxe)” earlier this year.

CNN,Sports,Alex Slitz/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/sport/pga-championship-third-round-scottie-scheffler-spt,"Moving day at the 2025 PGA Championship saw early thunderstorms turn to sunny skies while featuring the true, classic excitement fans were clamoring for the first two days of the tournament at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. And it all started with one player – Scottie Scheffler. The World No. 1 is back to doing things on the golf course that are expected. The 28-year-old propelled himself onto the top of the leaderboard after shooting a blistering 6-under 65 on the day, leaving him with a 11-under par for the tournament. He sits three strokes ahead of Alex Noren, who shot 5-under par in Saturday’s third round to put himself at 8-under par for the tournament. Scheffler is now 18 holes away from doing something he has never done – winning a major that isn’t the Masters. The two-time major winner has won at Augusta National twice in 2022 and 2024. Scheffler said it would “mean a lot” to bring home a third major championship. “These tournaments are very important to us, and you work your whole life to have a chance to win major tournaments, any tournament for that matter, and tomorrow I have a good opportunity to go out there and try and win the golf tournament,” Scheffler told CNN’s Patrick Snell after the round. “But it’s going to take another really good round. There’s a lot of great players chasing me on the leaderboard and someone is going to put up a great round and it’s up to me to go out there and have another really good round and finish off the tournament. Looking forward to the challenge.” Scheffler would become the 48th player in golf history to win three or more majors. Scheffler and Noren will tee off together on Sunday at 2:40 p.m. ET. The first two rounds saw an unlikely name claim the top of the leaderboard. Jhonattan Vegas. After becoming the first Venezuelan to hold the lead or co-lead in a major, Vegas looked to claim his first win in one of golf’s most prized tournaments. Saturday turned out to more of a struggle than not for the 40-year-old. Vegas shot 2-over par to tumble the leaderboard to a tie for fifth place with LIV Golf star Jon Rahm and Si Woo Kim. Despite sitting five-strokes back of Scheffler, Vegas can still accomplish something he has never done in his golf career. Getting his first top 20 finish at a major. “That’s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world,” Bryson DeChambeau told reporters after Saturday’s third round that saw his lead quickly disapear as quickly as it came. The LIV Golf star walked onto the 16th hole tee box with the outright lead at hand after sinking five birdies in the round to get to 8-under par and a one-stroke lead over Vegas and Davis Riley at the time. However, Quail Hollow’s infamous “Green Mile” ate him up and spit him back out which resulted in that lead going away and potentially never coming back. A bogey on the 16th, a double bogey on the 17th saw him fall to 5-under par and sit in a tie for 8th place entering Sunday’s final round. DeChambeau said the wind factored in the poor finish to the round but added he will “control what he can control” with quite a bit of ground to catch up. “It was just an unfortunate series of events that I can handle. It’s just, it’s golf. Sometimes that happens,” DeChambeau said. The 31-year-old will tee off with Tony Finau at 2 p.m. ET.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/18/sport/green-mile-quail-hollow-pga-championship-spt,"They say the Masters doesn’t really get going until the second nine on Sunday. The coveted Green Jacket has been won and lost many times over the years especially when the iconic three holes known as Amen Corner loom large. At Quail Hollow – the host venue for this year’s PGA Championship – there’s another trio of holes that have been conspiring to make plenty in the field here in North Carolina sweat profusely. And it’s not just down to the sweltering temperatures out there on the course! The last three holes at this famous Charlotte venue are known as the Green Mile. For some, it’s one of the most difficult closing sequence of holes in the sport. In total, they measure just under 1,250 yards. The par-4 16th is a gargantuan 529 yards. It’s followed by a 223-yard par-3 and the closing hole – also a par 4 – comes in at 494 yards. Water is a clear and present danger across all three holes. Simply put, it’s a brutal test of every golfer’s resolve and patience. Just ask Bryson DeChambeau. He was at 8-under par and making a real charge late in the day Saturday before the perils of the Green Mile kicked in. After two straight birdies, then came a bogey at 16 and a double bogey at 17. ”It was just a tale of the wind going into me instead of downwind. It cost me three shots and that’s what happens here at Quail Hollow,” the US Open champion said. The 31 year-old, who plays on the LIV Golf circuit, doesn’t feel he did a whole lot wrong en route to a 2-under par third round 69 which only served to increase his frustrations. ”That’s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world,” DeChambeau lamented. The top-ranked player in the men’s game is Scottie Scheffler. But even he is well aware of the threat posed by the Green Mile, although he navigated it well on Saturday as he powered his way into a three shot lead. “The approach shot into 16 is really tough. The tee shot on 17 is really tough. Then you’ve got 2 really challenging shots on 18 with the water on the left side,” Scheffler said. “There’s no real breathers in that stretch of holes and should make for a fun finish.” Fun is perhaps not the word Scheffler would have chosen after Thursday’s opening round during which he, the recently-crowned Masters champion Rory McIIroy and this tournament’s defending champion Xander Schauffele all double-bogeyed 16, albeit while battling demanding course conditions following the deluge of rain earlier in the week. McIIroy knows this course like the back of his hand. He’s won four times at Quail Hollow during his storied career but even he found himself having to avoid a double bogey at the last on Friday to stay in the tournament for the weekend. In the end, the five-time Major winner achieved his goal but only after a bogey following one at 17 too. Or take the plight of Justin Thomas who was the winner the last time the PGA Championship was played at Quail Hollow in 2017. Thomas – who won recently in South Carolina – failed to make the cut after two untimely bogeys in his last three holes. The Green Mile is not all doom and gloom though. It can even at times provide players with a big break when it comes to a stray rake. That was the experience of Venezuela’s Jhonattan Vegas who led the tournament through the first two rounds. On Friday, the South American’s drive at 17 was well off target before it struck a rake near a greenside bunker and then flew onto the green from where he would save par. “It was one of those things that happens in the sport. Sometimes you get a sprinkler head that goes out-of-bounds or the cart path that goes out-of-bounds or sometimes you hit a rake that goes on the green,” the four-time PGA Tour winner reflected. “It’s just part of the game, and you’ve just got to enjoy it all,” he added. Or how about the Ryan Gerard approach? The young American is playing in his first PGA Championship in his home state too. Gerard attended the University of North Carolina and as a college golfer, there was one sure way to try and conquer that daunting close hole at Quail Hollow. “I’ll give you a fun anecdote. In 2018, so six months after the PGA, we came out here as preparation for the NCAA nationals, and our coach made all six of us go on 18 tee and everyone had to play the 18th hole until all six made a par and at the same time in the same group,” the 25 year-old told reporters. “So, we were out there for quite a while. I learned a lot about the 18th hole on that day, and I hope that carries forward into this week.” There’s no question other factors will come into play during what’s sure to be a tension-filled final round but we can be sure of one thing. It’s highly likely Quail Hollow’s notoriously demanding finishing stretch will go a long way in determining who will lift the famed Wanamaker Trophy come Sunday evening.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Justin Setterfield/The FA/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/sport/crystal-palace-manchester-city-fa-cup-final-spt-intl,"Crystal Palace has won its first major trophy after beating Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final on Saturday. For Manchester City and Pep Guardiola, the final loss represents a first trophyless season since the 2016-17 campaign. Oliver Glasner’s side took the lead in the first half at Wembley Stadium in London when Eberechi Eze finished off a customary Crystal Palace counterattack. Manchester City piled on the pressure for the remainder of the game and will regret passing on missed opportunities throughout – including a missed penalty from Omar Marmoush. Crystal Palace took the lead in the 16th minute with a free-flowing goal its fans have grown accustomed to seeing during Glasner’s time in charge of the club. The South London team went from back-to-front in lightning speed with a trademark counterattack. Jean-Philippe Mateta held the ball up on the halfway line before finding full-back Daniel Muñoz galloping down Palace’s right-hand side with one of his customary bursts. Muñoz looked up before delivering a low cross into the Manchester City box which found the onrushing Eze perfectly. The 26-year-old then swept the ball into the far corner of the net and sent the Crystal Palace fans into a state of delirium. Manchester City dominated before the goal and continued to pile on the pressure at 1-0 down. Guardiola’s team was soon rewarded for its constant pressure when Bernardo Silva was brought down by Tyrick Mitchell in the Crystal Palace penalty area. Marmoush stepped up to take the spot kick for Manchester City but saw his penalty brilliantly saved by Dean Henderson in the Palace goal. Crystal Palace went in at the halftime break with a 1-0 lead, knowing it was 45 minutes from making history. The second half saw more of the same with Crystal Palace defending doggedly to prevent a Manchester City equalizer. Henderson continued to prove his worth in the Palace net, thwarting Manchester City efforts on countless occasions. As time ran out, Manchester City ran out of ideas and Crystal Palace held on to seal a historic win for the club. “It’s special,” matchwinner Eze told BBC Sport after the game. “I don’t even know what to say.” Crystal Palace came into the game as heavy underdogs. The club had never won a major trophy in its long history and was facing a side which has dominated English football in recent years. Manchester City has won the Premier League six times since the 2017-18 season, alongside a host of other major honors. But this Crystal Palace team did not let the history books distract them from the task at hand. “I think that’s what’s amazing is that we can do something nobody in Crystal Palace history has done,” Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards told CNN Sports’ Darren Lewis prior to the final. And Crystal Palace did just that, making history thanks to Eze’s goal. The American defender also told Lewis of Eze’s importance to the team. “He does things out here that nobody would expect – I don’t even have the creativity in my brain to think of some of the stuff that he does,” Richards said of his talismanic teammate. “He’s one of those guys who leads by example. He doesn’t have too much to say but when he does say it you understand that it’s probably coming from a good place.” Not only does this win represent a first major honor for Crystal Palace, but the club will now also be playing in Europe for the first time in its history next season. Celebrations of Crystal Palace fans will last deep into the night after breaking its long drought and will surely now continue around the continent next season.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Kim Klement/USA Today Sports/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/sport/antonio-brown-detained-after-gunshots-spt,"Miami (AP) — Antonio Brown was briefly detained by police early Saturday following an altercation in which gunshots were fired outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami, according to the former NFL star and video posted to social media. Miami police confirmed in a written statement that officers responded to the area at about 3 a.m. after receiving an alert from the gunshot-detection system ShotSpotter. Officer Kiara Delva, a department spokeswoman, said police questioned several people but made no arrests. No injuries were reported at the scene. The investigation continues, Delva said, and she could not confirm the names of anyone involved. Video posted to social media showed Brown involved in a fight with several people at the boxing event, which was hosted by popular streamer Adin Ross. He was seen apparently holding a black pistol as he pursued someone. Shots could be heard off camera shortly thereafter. Additional video showed Brown, hands behind his back, being escorted from the venue by an officer. Brown posted on social media that he had been “jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me.” “Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED,” Brown wrote. Brown’s statement did not mention the gunshots. Brown played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010 to 2018, where he emerged as one of the NFL’s top receiving threats and twice led the league in receiving yards. His career took a downturn because of various on- and off-field issues, including his contract being voided by the Oakland Raiders before the start of the 2019 season. He split his final three NFL seasons with New England and Tampa Bay, and his career ended with Brown stripping off his jersey, pads and gloves, while walking off the field during the Buccaneers’ 2021 regular-season finale against the New York Jets. Brown announced his retirement a few months later.",2025-05-18
CNN,Sports,Rob Carr/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/17/sport/journalism-wins-150th-preakness-stakes-spt,"The favorite Journalism came from behind to the finish line first Saturday to win the 150th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. Journalism edged Gosger by a half-length in a thrilling race that had no Triple Crown implications. Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty did not compete in the second leg of the three races that make up the Triple Crown. The colt instead is preparing for the Belmont Stakes on June 7. Journalism, ridden by Umberto Rispoli and trained by Michael McCarthy, entered the field of nine horses at 6-5 odds. Journalism was bumped by Goal Oriented as the horses rounded the far turn before Journalism regained some momentum. But down the stretch, it appeared Journalism would have another second-place Triple Crown finish. Journalism was the runnerup at the Kentucky Derby on May 3. But the three-year-old closed out strong, blowing passed Gosger, a 15-1 longshot, in the end. Rispoli reflected on his first career Preakness mount. “When I first came to the United States, you can’t really realize what the Triple Crown means until you go with a favorite horse to ride at the Kentucky Derby,” Rispoli said in an NBC post-race interview. “I can tell you, I couldn’t sleep for four nights after the Kentucky Derby.” He added: “This take some of the pain off and I’m glad to have this opportunity. I had to wait 20 years, but it was worth the wait.” McCarthy picked up his second career Preakness victory and thought that there would be another second place ending when Journalism was behind. “When I saw that, I kind of resided myself to the fact that it was another fantastic effort, maybe come up a little short but it goes to show the testament that this horse has, couldn’t be prouder of him. “In the back of mind, I thought we’d be two for two here but you know what, just happy to get one of these. They are very, very difficult races to win.” Sandman finished third. Saturday’s race was the last one at historic Pimlico as ‘Old Hilltop’ w﻿ill be demolished and rebuilt for a modern building. The Preakness Stakes will relocate to Laurel Park in Maryland for the 2026 race, with the intention of the middle jewel of horse racing returning to Baltimore in 2027. This story has been updated with additional reporting.",2025-05-18
BBC,Business,"It's one of the most rowdy US sporting events. Here's what Preakness says about the economyThe Maryland tradition attracts a mix of socioeconomic classes. But this year, the tradition has been thrown into question.8 hrs agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lk0zq7kg5o,"A woman balancing a dozen cocktails on a tray atop her head inched carefully through the steadily building crowds and chaos on Saturday morning at the Pimlico Race Course clubhouse. ""How much is that,"" a man in purple trousers yelled towards her, the glassware inches above her eyebrow clanking as she paused. ""Twenty dollars,"" she replied. Ray De Rubin repeated the number in disbelief, mumbled an expletive under his breath, then said: ""I'll take two."" He and his mother were at Pimlico for the first time - here to wager on US horse racing's esteemed Preakness Stakes on its 150th anniversary. Just two weeks ago, during his 14th trip to the Kentucky Derby, he won big. ""This is the exact same outfit I wore on Derby day. Same underwear, same socks, same hat,"" he said. ""I still got my Derby wristband on."" His wager at Pimlico? ""I can't tell you. I don't want the IRS coming after me,"" he said with a grin. On the other side of Pimlico – just beyond the thousand-dollar seats, champagne flutes, and air-conditioned tents on the infield – five thoroughbreds idled behind the  starting line. Mr De Rubin had bets on three of them. There was a brief moment of quiet before the race. Then the gates flung open, and the horses took off. Mr De Rubin, eyes fixed on the screens above, stood frozen. But only for a moment. ""I get really loud when I watch the race. I put a lot of work into this,"" he said. One of three annual thoroughbred races - along with the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes - that make up what is known as the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes has long been known as one of the most glamorously bacchanal events in US sports. Held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, it brings together the rowdy and the rich. But this year, its traditions have been thrown into question. In his second term as president, Donald Trump has enforced swift, dramatic economic policy changes, leading to significant consumer pessimism. Virtually no corner of the American market has been spared - from the fast-food hamburger to the Preakness Stakes. Much of the current market-rattling turmoil is a result of Trump's sweeping global tariffs, announced on 2 April. Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", he said the new economic strategy would usher in ""the golden age of America"". Instead, in the 48 hours after his announcement, the S&P 500 had its worst two-day sell-off in years, as trillions of dollars were wiped from the stock market. Three weeks later, the International Monetary Fund warned of a global recession. Even McDonald's reported a drop in sales, which the burger chain's CEO attributed to customers ""grappling with uncertainty"".  But while the stock market has mostly recovered following tariff agreements with the UK and China, the tariffs' impact may be just beginning; mega corporations like Walmart and Amazon recently warned of price increases. But at Pimlico, the state of Maryland is betting big, with plans to demolish the track right after Saturday's event and rebuild a new course in its place, plus a state-of-the-art training facility. The tariffs' shadow looms here, too. ""We expect there to be some kind of impact,"" the Maryland Stadium Authority told the BBC in a statement. But for now, they said the effects on the half-billion dollar project remains unclear. Aside from tariffs, horse race attendance has shrunk in recent years. Just over 46,000 people attended the Preakness in 2024, down from the 131,000 that attended in 2019. The Derby drew a much larger crowd of roughly 150,000 this year but was still well under its peak of 170,000 in 2015. Bill Carstanjen, CEO of the Derby's home, Churchill Downs, said a dip in sales this year was due to buyer ""hesitancy"" that ""correlates perfectly"" with Trump's tariffs. ""We didn't have the endless pool of demand that we've seen in prior years,"" Mr Carstanjen told the Lexington Herald. Still, gambling records this year were broken at the Derby and Preakness. Over a week before the Preakness and before the horses running were finalised, a Preakness record of $348,000 was wagered on betting futures, up from last year's record of $260,000. All just a drop in the bucket compared to the millions that will be wagered by the time the last horse crosses the finish line. University of Kentucky economics professor Justin Balthrop told the BBC that a rise in gambling also could be a sign of economic distress. ""People who reach a certain level of despair will start to take on more risk, in an effort to literally gamble their way back to a place where they feel like they can be more comfortable,"" Professor Balthrop said. ""You combine that with this idea that maybe they are so pessimistic, that this gives them the dopamine rush or endorphin release."" Waiting in a long line on Pimlico's infield, Anthony Walker was among those looking for ""a little reprieve"". He was glad ""to be able to take a few hours away from all that instability"" in the stock market as well as the disruption caused by Trump's downsizing of the federal government. Mr Walker planned to gamble – ""you can't come to the race without putting a little something out there"" – but a bit less than he might have in more certain times. ""I'm wagering 50% less, for sure,"" he estimated. ""Because of what's happening in the economy – the way this administration is taking a wrecking ball to the longstanding traditions and institutions that give credence to the American way of life."" At the Preakness, there are still endless ways to get a quick dose of gambling-induced dopamine. Even for as little as 10 cents. ""I've seen a 10 cent (wager) pay $75,000,"" said Peter Rotondo, who heads racing and wagering for 1/ST, the organisation running Preakness. To do so, one would have to wager on what's called a superfecta: correctly guessing which four horses will place in the top four in the exact order, odds that are about on par with getting struck by lightning. ""That's the beauty of the super,"" Mr Rotondo said. The pricey cocktail Mr De Rubin grumbled about is the Black-Eyed Susan, also Maryland's official flower. The crazed concoction - bourbon, vodka, and a splash of mixers - leaves one to wonder whether it's truly a tribute to the state flower or a wink to the likely black eye after having too many. The drink is one of many traditions at the annual event. There's also the decades-old Tiffany & Co-made trophy called the Woodlawn Vase, considered ""the most valuable trophy in sports"". Made of 30lb of sterling silver, it's valued at an estimated $4m (£3m), and thus is kept in a museum most of the year. The Preakness winner leaves with a replica. But for many, the Preakness wouldn't be the Preakness without the party on the infield. ""I went a lot in my 20s and 30s. It was an absolutely crazy party,"" Bobby Duke, 51, said in an email to the BBC. ""In 1998, a guy jumped the fence and tried to punch a horse while racing. It's on YouTube."" Though Pimlico always had offerings for elegant, fans like Mr Duke fondly remember piling into the infield for ""the most salacious party on the sports calendar"", as ESPN once put it, where patrons would race across a long row of porta-pottys while dodging beer cans hurled at them by inebriated onlookers. (That tradition ended around 2009, when Pimlico stopped its BYOB policy.) Maryland officials said the new Pimlico will become a year-round racing facility, and hopefully bring an economic boost to the low-income Park Heights neighbourhood surrounding it. In his purple pants and every-colour-of-the-rainbow shirt, Mr De Rubin grew agitated as his luck began to unravel during the five-horse race. ""(Horse number five) is dead last. I don't think they're going to catch this,"" he said with growing animation, rattling the ice in his Black-Eyed Susan. He placed bets on horses one, three and five. ""Oh, (crap), the three horse. Here comes the one horse. Come on, one!"" In a span of about three minutes, the anticipation, anxiety, fear and hope all came crashing to an end. Mr De Rubin didn't win. But he didn't lose either. The even spread on the winning horse basically gave him back what he put into it. He compared the experience to today's seesaw stock market. ""Investing, and betting on horses, is gambling. You have ups and downs,"" he said. His stock portfolio has taken a wild downward spin through Trump's global tariff tit-for-tat. But recently it sprang back into the green and is up around 20%, he said. Unlike the horses, ""you can't watch the market. It'll give you a heart attack"", he advised. ""I have faith in Trump. He's a little crazy with it right now, but it'll all work out.""",2025-05-18
BBC,Business,US loses last perfect credit rating amid rising debtMoody's said successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs.1 day agoUS & Canada,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0xk4ld1o,"The US has lost its last perfect credit rating, as influential ratings firm Moody's expressed concern over the government's ability to pay back its debt. In lowering the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', Moody's noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs. A triple-A rating signifies a country's highest possible credit reliability, and indicates it is considered to be in very good financial health with a strong capacity to repay its debts. Moody's warned in 2023 the US triple-A rating was at risk. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings did so in 2011. Moody's held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917. The downgrade ""reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" Moody's said in the statement. In a statement, the White House said it was ""focused on fixing Biden's mess"", while taking a swipe at Moody's. ""If Moody's had any credibility,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, ""they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded."" A lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt, and generally face higher borrowing costs. Moody's maintained that the US ""retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency"". The firm said it expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year. GDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments, and people in a country. The BBC has reached out to the US Department of Treasury for comment. The downgrade came on the same day as Trump's landmark spending bill suffered a setback in Congress. Trump's so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" failed to pass the House Budget Committee, with some Republicans voting against it. Figures showed the US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs. The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter, the Commerce Department said.",2025-05-18
BBC,Business,Doom: One of gaming's oldest series reckons with the challenges of 2025Doom is one of the most well-known series in gaming but it still has to work to find new players.1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gezq2q911o,"Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom. First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry. But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025. Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles. BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges. While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face. ""There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,"" says executive producer Marty Stratton. Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts. There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as ""forever games"". In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P. Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher. Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can ""fit into those habits"". ""It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,"" he says. The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase. But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players. Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is. ""The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,"" he says. One way of doing this is by attracting new players. Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new ""Medieval sci-fi"" setting and altered gameplay style. ""We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,"" he says. The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages. ""In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,"" says Hugo. But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry. The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years. In 2010, a new game cost roughly £40 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time. If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about £60 in today's money. Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs £69.99 for a standard edition or almost £100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included. ""When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,"" says Marty. The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers. That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players. But Doom producer Marty argues that ""free"" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are ""no unknown expenses"" with a one-off purchase such as Doom. ""You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,"" he says. F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from ""microtransactions"" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds. Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about £22 a month on those transactions. That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a ""curated experience"" with ""replay value"". ""Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,"" he says. Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more ""fiddling with prices"" and surcharges ""to see what customers are willing to pay"" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases. ""Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,"" he says. Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at £14.99 a month. There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price. Game Pass players could pay a £34.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content. Rhys says we are likely to see more of these sorts of offers are aimed at ""superfans"" who want to keep up with the latest releases. For everyone else, waiting is an option. ""You can pick up the first 2016 Doom game for like £4 right now,"" says Rhys. Doom's makers, perhaps unsurprisingly, believe their latest is worth jumping into. ""We think about price when we're developing it - we obviously want the value to be there for players,"" says Marty. ""Ultimately, it's a market. Players will determine what they want to spend."" ""I think it's there's obviously still a place for a good, premium, highly polished, fun single-player game,"" adds Hugo.

BBC,Business,"US proposes dropping Boeing criminal charge Families criticised the move, which would avoid a trial that is due to begin in June.2 days agoBusiness",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ge0lpqpyro,"US prosecutors may drop a criminal charge against the aerospace giant Boeing, linked to two crashes involving its bestselling aircraft, the 737 Max. In an online meeting with relatives of those who died in the two accidents, officials for the Department of Justice (DOJ) said they were considering allowing the company to sign a non-prosecution agreement to settle the case. The move would avoid a trial over the criminal fraud charge that is due to begin in June, after a judge rejected an earlier settlement in which Boeing had agreed to plead guilty. Lawyers representing families of the crash victims said they were ""deeply disappointed"" by the new plan. ""While DOJ claims no final decision has been made, their scripted presentation made it clear that the outcome has already been decided,"" said Erin Applebaum, a partner at Kreindler and Kreindler, which represents 34 families of those killed in the Ethiopian crash. ""Boeing has never stood trial for the 346 lives lost due to its admitted crimes. Now, DOJ is prepared to let the company walk away, again, with no more than a financial penalty,"" she added.  Boeing currently faces a criminal fraud conspiracy charge, brought in the aftermath of two major 737 Max accidents in late 2018 off Indonesia and in Ethiopia in early 2019. The crashes, which killed 346 people, were blamed on a poorly designed piece of flight control software, which the pilots were not aware had been fitted to the aircraft. The Department of Justice subsequently accused Boeing of deliberately concealing vital information about the system from regulators, charging the firm with fraud. The firm admitted to the allegations but initially avoided prosecution by paying $2.5bn in fines and compensation and pledging to improve safety standards and compliance programmes. The case was reopened last year, after an incident in which an unused door fell off a 737 Max early in flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft. The DOJ  accused Boeing of having breached the terms of the original settlement. Last year, during the Biden administration, a new deal was reached with prosecutors under which Boeing would plead guilty to the fraud charge, pay a further fine of $243m and agree to a court-appointed monitor overseeing its operations for a set period. But the agreement was rejected in December by a US district court judge overseeing the case, due in part to concerns over how the monitor would be selected. The ruling meant the case would extend into the Trump administration, which has promised to take a lighter regulatory approach. It is understood that Boeing has since sought to withdraw its guilty plea. Boeing declined to comment on Friday. The Department of Justice did not respond. A non-prosecution agreement would not involve admitting to criminal charges. That would spare Boeing from a criminal record, a black mark that would complicate its dealings as a contractor for the government. The case is currently due to go to trial on 23 June.",2025-05-18
BBC,Business,"Why youth mobility and fishing are key issues ahead of UK-EU summitYouth mobility and fishing rights are key negotiating points between the UK and the EU as PM Keir Starmer attempts a post-Brexit ""reset"".1 day ago",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxykl7kypno,"The right of young people to move freely between the UK and EU has emerged as a key negotiating point - along with fishing rights - ahead of a summit in London which the prime minister hopes will ""reset"" relations between the two sides. Before Brexit, people were allowed to come and go under ""freedom of movement"" rules. The EU would like a new ""youth mobility scheme"" but there are concerns about what impact this might have on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are another potential sticking point with the EU calling for an extension of the current post-Brexit deal, but UK fishing groups calling for changes to it. BBC Verify has been examining both issues and why they are important. Since Brexit, UK and EU citizens no longer have an automatic right to live, work, or study in each other's countries. To come to the UK for an extended period, EU nationals usually need specific visas - many of which require a sponsor. Following these new rules, there has been a significant drop in the number of EU students coming to the UK. The UK does have an existing Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) which allows young adults to live, work and study in the UK for up to two years. People from specific countries can apply but not from EU ones. They have to pay an application fee, the health surcharge, and have at least £2,530 in savings. Unlike most other visa schemes, the YMS does not require sponsorship. Last year, just over 24,000 YMS visas were issued - Australians were the largest single group, followed by New Zealanders and Canadians. Just over a year ago, the EU proposed a ""youth mobility scheme"" for EU and UK citizens (aged 18 to 30), allowing stays of up to four years. The idea was rejected by the-then Conservative government. It it is politically sensitive, given Sir Keir Starmer's pledge to ""significantly"" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has warned against ""backsliding on freedom of movement"". Documents circulated between EU states suggested any deal could be rebranded as a ""youth experience"" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration. Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a UK/EU youth mobility scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive. However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal. ""If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang, all come at once,"" she said. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap. Another consideration, Ms Sumption points out, is how many people would go home when their temporary visa comes to an end. ""Even on temporary visas, people do stay. They get a job offer and end up getting a skilled visa through their employer"", she says. The Oxford Migration Observatory says about 10% of people who arrived on temporary worker visas in 2014 from Australia, Canada and New Zealand remained in the UK at the end of 2023. Fishing is another sensitive subject. The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights - who gets to fish where - expires at the end of June 2026. Several EU countries, including France, are asking the UK for concessions, in return for the things the UK wants from the summit. They are pushing for a long-term extension of the current arrangements, agreed in 2020. Fishing only accounts for an estimated 0.4% of UK GDP but it was a big issue in the Brexit campaign and promises were made that the UK would become an ""independent coastal state"". Under the Brexit deal in 2020 however, EU boats were given continued access to UK waters. In 2023, UK vessels landed 719,000 tonnes of fish - an increase of 14% compared to 2019. However, this growth has been driven by Scottish catches, while English fishing boats have seen a fall in their landings. This is linked to the way in which fish quotas were divided up after Brexit, benefitting some areas. At the same time, it has become harder for the UK to export fish to the EU due to post-Brexit paperwork and checks. In 2023, the UK exported 235,606 tonnes of fish to the EU. That's down 29% compared to the 2019 figure of 333,403 tonnes. Chris Ranford, Chief Executive of the Cornish Fish Producers' Organisation (CFPO), represents 175 member vessels and says nothing much has changed, since BBC Verify last spoke to him in 2022. He says French vessels are still fishing off the Cornish coast: ""Very modern, very high-powered French fishing vessels that have much greater catching capacity than the UK or Cornish boats come up to the six-mile line. We don't have space to fish."" For him, the number one priority for any future fishing deal is to stop EU vessels entering the stretch of coastal water that lies between six and 12 nautical miles offshore. France has reportedly called for continued access to UK waters for its fishing boats, in exchange for a defence deal the UK is pushing for. We asked the Maritime Fisheries Committee for Northern France for comment. Another area of improvement Mr Ranford is calling for is easier access to EU markets. ""Our small to medium-sized businesses can't afford to do the extra paperwork to get the fish to the EU market,"" he said. Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, says: ""The market access to the EU has become more bureaucratic."" She says she is disappointed with the five-year fishing deal the UK signed up to. ""Our position approaching the EU reset… is that the access to each other's waters would be on the basis of annual discussions"". ""By having that lever around access, the UK could secure a much fairer share of the resources in our own waters."" There are strong opinions on both sides on fishing and youth mobility. If the UK is to get what it wants from the summit, including easing the trade in agricultural goods between the UK and the EU, there will have to be some give and take in the coming days.

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Eurovision 2025: Austria wins with last-minute vote, as the UK comes 19thAustrian counter-tenor JJ wins with Wasted Love, but the UK gets zero points from the public.9 hrs agoCulture",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15nq75274qo,"Austrian singer JJ has won the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland, after a nail-biting finish that saw him topple Israel from pole position at the very last minute. The 24-year-old, who is a counter-tenor at the Vienna State Opera, took the title with the song Wasted Love, a tempestuous electro-ballad about unrequited love. ""Thank you so much for making my dreams come true,"" he said as he accepted the coveted glass microphone trophy. ""Love is the strongest force in the world, let's spread more love."" The singer scored 436 points, with Israel in second place on 357 and Estonia third on 356. The UK's act, Remember Monday, placed 19th with 88 points. For the second year in a row, the UK received zero from the public. JJ's younger sister broke through security guards to hug him after his victory was announced. The Austrian said his whole family had arrived to support him at the contest, including his 85-year-old grandfather, and a four-month-old niece, who watched outside with his brother. It is the third time Austria has won the contest, with previous victories going to Udo Jürgens' Merci, Cherie in 1966; and Conchita Wurst with Rise Like a Phoenix in 2014. JJ was inspired to take part in Eurovision by Conchita. The singer had always been one of the favourites to win, but the most hotly-tipped contestants were Sweden's KAJ - whose tongue-in-cheek ode to sauna culture, Bara Bada Bastu, ultimately took fourth place. Speaking after the show, JJ said he was ""so pleased"" that viewers had connected with his story of heartache. ""I wanted to let them have an insight on my deepest soul [and] how I felt when we wrote the song."" ""What I'm trying to commit [to] is that there's no wasted love. There's so much love that we can spread around. It's the strongest force on planet earth."" Asked how he would celebrate, he replied: ""Honestly, I need to sleep now. I'm tired."" For the second year in a row, there was controversy over Israel's participation, with protestors arguing for the country's dismissal over its military action in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protests took place on the streets of Basel in the hours before the contest. Later, a man and a woman were prevented from invading the stage during Israel's performance. ""One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit,"" said Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR in a statement to the BBC. ""The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. ""The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police."" The performance, by young singer Yuval Raphael, was unaffected. The 25-year-old is a survivor of the Hamas attacks of 7 October, 2023, an experience which coloured her delicate ballad, New Day Will Rise. The Israeli delegation said Raphael was left ""shaken and upset"" by the incident, but that it was ""extremely proud"" of her performance ""which represented Israel in a respectful manner"". Elsewhere, Eurovision was its usual explosion of high camp, sexual innuendo and dresses being removed to reveal smaller, tighter dresses. Malta's Mariana Conte was forced to rewrite her disco anthem Serving Kant to remove what sounded like a swear word - but performed the censored version with a knowing wink, safe in the knowledge the audience would fill in the blanks. Although it was a fan favourite, Conte could only manage 17th. Estonia's Tommy Cash, who came third, also kept the innuendo train running, with Espresso Macchiato, a caffeinated disco anthem featuring the unforgettable phrase: ""Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it."" Another highlight was Finland's Erika Vikman, who dispensed with double entendres entirely on Ich Komme, a vibrant hymn to sexual pleasure. The singer ended her performance by taking flight on a giant phallic microphone that shot sparks into the air. It thrust her into 11th position, and a permanent place in the Eurovision pantheon.  The contest also dealt with more weighty subjects like economic migration (Portuguese rock band Napa) and environmental catastrophe (Latvia's Tautumeitas, who scored 12 points from the UK jury). Dutch singer Claude delivered a heartfelt tribute to his mother in C'est La Vie - an upbeat anthem that reflected on her positivity as she uprooted the family from their home country of the Democratic Republic of Congo as a child. In a touching climax, the 21-year-old danced with an image of his childhood self in a mirror on the stage.  Also reflecting on their childhood was French singer Louane, whose tearjerking ballad was dedicated to her mother, who died of cancer when she was 17. In one of the night's most striking performances, she was surrounded by a whirlwind of sand as she hollered the word ""mother"" over and over again. One of the favourites to win, it ended the night in seventh place, after receiving a disappointing 50 points from the public. JJ's performance was similarly dramatic. Shot entirely in black and white, it saw him being tossed around on a rickety boat, as waves (of emotion) threatened to consume him. An honourable mention also goes to Italy's Lucio Corsi, whose harmonica solo in Volevo Essere Un Duro marked the first time a live instrument has been played at Eurovision since 1998. The UK spent a third year in the bottom half of the leaderboard, despite a spirited performance from girl group Remember Monday. A group of friends who met at high school, their inventive pop song What The Hell Just Happened? drew on their many years of experience in West End theatre. The girls pulled off their tricky three-part harmonies while dancing around a fallen chandelier, but the performance didn't connect with voters. Despite earning a healthy 88 points from juries - including 12 from Italy -  it bombed with viewers. They ended in 19th place, one below last year's entrant Olly Alexander. The group laughed off their ""nul points"" score from the public, holding up peace signs and hugging each other as the score was announced. The voting was utter chaos. Thirteen of the 26 finalists received the maximum of 12 points from at least one jury, leaving the competition completely open before the public vote was counted. Israel, who had been languishing in the bottom half of the table, then received 297 points from the public (out of a possible maximum of 444). Twelve of those points came from the UK. For a while, it looked like Yuval Raphael's lead might be unassailable - but Austria's tally of 178 was the last to be announced, leaving the singer empty-handed. And spare a thought for Switzerland. Their contestant, Zoë Më, was in second place after the jury vote, with 214 points. Then the public gave her the night's only other zero-point score. To gasps in the arena, her song Voyage was demoted to 10th place. There was disappointment, too, for fans of Canadian singer Céline Dion, who had been rumoured to appear at the contest. The singer won Eurovision for Switzerland in 1988, and had appeared in a video wishing the contestants good luck at Tuesday's semi-final. Despite hopes from Eurovision organisers that she might turn up, the moment never came to pass. ",2025-05-18
BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Elton brands government 'losers' over AI copyright plansThe musician accuses the government of robbing young artists over its copyright law plans.3 hrs ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8jg0348yvxo,"Sir Elton John described the government as ""absolute losers"" and said he feels ""incredibly betrayed"" over plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws. Speaking exclusively to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said if ministers go ahead with plans to allow AI firms to use artists' content without paying, they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"". This week the government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes. A government spokesperson said that ""no changes"" to copyright laws would be ""considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators"". Generative AI programmes mine, or learn, from vast amounts of data like text, images, or music online to generate new content which feels like it has been made by a human. Sir Elton said the ""danger"" is that, for young artists, ""they haven't got the resources ... to fight big tech [firms]"". ""It's criminal, in that I feel incredibly betrayed,"" he added. ""The House of Lords did a vote, and it was more than two to one in our favour,"" he said. ""The government just looked at it as if to say, 'Hmm, well the old people ... like me can afford it.'"" On Monday, the House of Lords voted by a 147 majority to amend the Data (Use and Access) Bill to add transparency requirements, which aim to ensure copyright holders have to give permission for their work to be used. But on Wednesday MPs in the House of Commons voted to reject this change, meaning the bill will continue to go back and forth between the two Houses until they reach an agreement on it. Sir Elton warned the government was on course to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"", adding that he thought the government was ""just being absolute losers, and I'm very angry about it"". The singer said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to ""wise up"" and described Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as ""a bit of a moron"". He said if the government does not change its plans, he would be ready to take ministers to court, saying that ""we'll fight it all the way"". Speaking alongside the 78-year-old, playwright James Graham said ministers ""do understand the value of creativity... but what's frustrating is either the complacency or the willingness to let Silicon Valley tech bros get it all their own way"". The chief executive of UK music, Tom Kiehl, told the BBC that the government is ""on the brink"" of offering up the country's music industry ""as a sacrificial lamb in its efforts to cosy up to American-based tech giants"". He added that the prime minister ""must not sell"" the next generation of singers, songwriters, musicians, and music creators ""down the river and allow all that talent to be crushed by letting soulless AI bots plunder their work"". Ahead of the vote in the House of Lords, Sir Elton joined more than 400 British musicians, writers, and artists in signing a letter calling on the prime minister to update copyright laws in a way that protects them from artificial intelligence. Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney, who also signed the letter, previously told the BBC there was a risk AI would create a ""Wild West"" in which artists' copyright was not properly protected. A government spokesperson said it wants the UK's creative industries and AI companies to ""flourish, which is why we're consulting on a package of measures that we hope will work for both sectors"". The spokesperson said it was ""vital"" the government worked through responses to a consultation on proposals to allow developers to use creators' content unless rights holders elected to ""opt out"". They added that it was ""equally important that we put in the groundwork now as we consider the next steps"". ""That is why we have committed to publishing a report and economic impact assessment - exploring the broad range of issues and options on all sides of the debate.""

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Doom: One of gaming's oldest series reckons with the challenges of 2025Doom is one of the most well-known series in gaming but it still has to work to find new players.1 day ago,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gezq2q911o,"Few names are as synonymous with video games as Doom. First launched in 1993, the first-person shooter (FPS) remains one of the most influential - and popular - series in the industry. But even it and its superhuman protagonist, The Doom Slayer, have to contend with the pressures of the games industry in 2025. Attracting new players, competing with the new titans on the scene and the rising cost of making - and selling - blockbuster titles. BBC Newsbeat spoke to the project leaders of the latest instalment, Doom: The Dark Ages, about navigating some of these challenges. While the Doom series is famous for pitting players against colossal enemies, there are other behemoths it has to face. ""There's so much stuff competing for our attention these days, whether it's games, movies, or whatever,"" says executive producer Marty Stratton. Free-to-play (F2P) games, such as Fortnite and Roblox, and annually updated series such as Call of Duty and EA FC regularly dominate most-played charts. There's evidence to suggest players, particularly younger ones, are spending most of their time on these titles - sometimes referred to as ""forever games"". In the latest Online Nation report by UK regulator Ofcom, five of the top ten games among UK players were F2P. Fortnite recorded about 2.65m active UK users in May 2024, and Roblox 1.22m, according to the report, and global figures are much higher. Drawing those players to premium titles can be a challenge but Marty argues games such as Doom, which can be completed in under 20 hours, can ""fit into those habits"". ""It doesn't have to become your obsession for the next two years,"" he says. The Doom series - developed by Dallas-based ID Software - has an advantage over others because it's so well-known and has a large, loyal fanbase. But, as industry expert Rhys Elliot, from Alinea Analytics, tells Newsbeat, it's getting harder to rely solely on your hardcore players. Overall, he says, the number of people playing premium titles isn't increasing, but the cost of making them is. ""The people who make games - they still need to make revenues each year because, you know, capitalism,"" he says. One way of doing this is by attracting new players. Doom's director Hugo Martin says the response to Doom: The Dark Age's previews were encouraging - something he puts down in part to its new ""Medieval sci-fi"" setting and altered gameplay style. ""We see it in the comments - a lot of people are saying 'I think this is going to be my first Doom', and that's exciting for us,"" he says. The games industry has also leaned into customisation in recent years, giving players the power to finely tweak different elements and aspects of difficulty - something that's been incorporated into The Dark Ages. ""In that regard I think it's going to be a great first-time experience for a lot of fans,"" says Hugo. But there's still the small matter of the cost of entry. The debate over prices has been a feature of gaming discourse for years. In 2010, a new game cost roughly £40 in the UK - and players had plenty to say about it at the time. If you take into account inflation (using this Bank of England tool), that would be about £60 in today's money. Doom: The Dark Ages itself costs £69.99 for a standard edition or almost £100 for a limited Premium Edition with extras included. ""When you look at the history of game pricing... it really hasn't skyrocketed,"" says Marty. The issue has been thrown back into the spotlight thanks to worries over Donald Trump's tariff plans and price announcements from the three major console makers. That could make competitors such as Fortnite - which don't require new, specialised hardware to run - even more appealing for cash-strapped players. But Doom producer Marty argues that ""free"" games can end up costing players more in the long run, while there are ""no unknown expenses"" with a one-off purchase such as Doom. ""You're not going to be asked to pay anything else, two hours in,"" he says. F2P games generate cash with in-game purchases, ranging from ""microtransactions"" equivalent to a handful of change or, in some cases, hundreds of pounds. Those costs can mount up, and a recent poll of 2,001 gamers by British bank TSB suggested dedicated players can spend about £22 a month on those transactions. That's still less than a tentpole new release, but Doom's director Hugo also believes people are happy to pay more for a ""curated experience"" with ""replay value"". ""Typically, if you just make a really good game then people will want to play it again,"" he says. Analyst Rhys believes we're going to see more ""fiddling with prices"" and surcharges ""to see what customers are willing to pay"" and a wider range of RRPs for new releases. ""Hopefully there'll be more competition there. It's good for consumers,"" he says. Doom is also available on PC and Xbox via Game Pass - Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription priced at £14.99 a month. There's evidence more people are turning to this, as well as Sony's PlayStation Plus - raising questions over whether they put players off paying full price. Game Pass players could pay a £34.99/$34.99 upgrade fee to access the game two days early and receive bonus content. Rhys says we are likely to see more of these sorts of offers are aimed at ""superfans"" who want to keep up with the latest releases. For everyone else, waiting is an option. ""You can pick up the first 2016 Doom game for like £4 right now,"" says Rhys. Doom's makers, perhaps unsurprisingly, believe their latest is worth jumping into. ""We think about price when we're developing it - we obviously want the value to be there for players,"" says Marty. ""Ultimately, it's a market. Players will determine what they want to spend."" ""I think it's there's obviously still a place for a good, premium, highly polished, fun single-player game,"" adds Hugo.

BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Mexico accuses MrBeast of exploiting Mayan pyramidsAuthorities say they never allowed Jimmy Donaldson to film at pyramid heritage sites for profit.1 day agoLatin America,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr70vykk0wo,"Mexico is seeking compensation from the producers of a MrBeast video and has accused the US YouTuber of exploiting its ancient pyramids for commercial gain. The video ""I Explored 2000 Year Old Ancient Temples"" shows the influencer, real name Jimmy Donaldson, 27, and his team exploring ancient Mayan cities, with a permit. But in one part of the video produced by Full Circle Media, which has received more than 60 million views in a  week, MrBeast advertises a  chocolate product as a ""Mayan dessert"" and urges viewers to buy it. Authorities said that while they had granted permission to film at the sites, they had not permitted for-profit use. A MrBeast representative denied some of the accusations. The spokesperson told the BBC: ""No advertisement material was shot on any archaeological sites overseen by INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History)."" In the video, the scene promoting the chocolate snack appears to be filmed at the influencer's camping site. The spokesperson also said the video was ""meant to highlight these treasured Mayan sites in Mexico"" and that it was ""unfortunate that this has turned into a political issue - hopefully it can lead to a productive dialogue and encourages people to visit these unique historical treasures"". Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday called for an investigation into the conditions under which the filming permit had been granted. In the video's caption, MrBeast thanks Mexican tourism and government authorities for permission to film in the sites, while also plugging links to his chocolate product. The video shows him and his team exploring areas of restricted access in the Mayan cities of Calakmul and Chichén Itzá. At one point he says ""I can't believe the government's letting us do this."" They are also shown appearing to descend into a pyramid from a helicopter and in another scene are shown handling an ancient pre-Hispanic mask. But heritage authorities said these were ""false assertions"" and accused the YouTuber of presenting misinformation. INAH said MrBeast had never held a real pre-Hispanic mask and there appeared to have been extensive post-production editing in the video - such as the helicopter scene. ""All of these are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the YouTuber in question,"" its statement on Monday read. Mexico's Secretary of Culture Claudia Curiel de Icaza said on Thursday that, although they had authorised the permit for MrBeast to film, they had never authorised the publication of false information or the use of heritage site images for trademark advertising. ""We disapprove of any commercial pursuit that distorts the value of archaeological sites, which are a legacy of our indigenous cultures and the pride of our nation,"" she said. She added that, although Mexico was open to content that contributes to the ""knowledge and dissemination of Mexico's archaeological and cultural heritage"" it was firmly against those who ""take advantage of the willingness of institutions"". She said INAH would consider ""administrative sanctions"" against Full Circle Media, who was issued the permit to film. The BBC has sought comment from the firm. MrBeast, dubbed the King of YouTube, is the most-subscribed to person on the platform, with 395 million followers. His Mayan pyramids video was published on 10 May.",2025-05-18
BBC,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Rushdie attacker sentenced to 25 years in prisonSir Salman was on a New York lecture stage, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck leaving him partially blinded.2 days agoUS & Canada",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp85kg527p9o,"A New Jersey man who stabbed and partially blinded novelist Sir Salman Rushdie on a New York lecture stage was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Friday. Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted of attempted murder and assault earlier this year. Sir Salman was on stage speaking before an audience in August 2022, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck. The attack left him blind in one eye, with damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm. The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. Matar received the maximum 25-year sentence for the attempted murder of Sir Salman. He was also found guilty of assault for wounding the person who was interviewing Sir Salman, Henry Reese, and sentenced to seven years plus three years post-release for that assault. The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said on Friday. Before being sentenced, Matar stood and made a statement about freedom of speech in which he called Rushdie a hypocrite, according to the Associated Press. ""Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people,"" said Matar, clad in white-striped jail clothing and wearing handcuffs. ""He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don't agree with that."" Sir Salman was not in the court for his assailant's sentencing on Friday. Matar was convicted of attempted murder and assault in February, 2025, following an intense trial during which Sir Salman detailed the moment when he felt certain that he was going to die. During the two-week trial, he testified that he saw a man rushing towards him while on stage at the historic arts institute in Chautauqua, New York. He said his assailant's eyes ""were dark and seemed very ferocious"". Sir Salman told the court he initially did not realise he had been stabbed, thinking instead that he had been punched. Matar stabbed Sir Salman 15 times in total including to his cheek, chest, eye, neck and thigh. Prosecutors argued that the attack was targeted. ""There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,"" prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt then told the jury. Defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan had argued that prosecutors failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman. Matar, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify in his defence. His lawyers did not call any witnesses of their own. ""I don't think he's a very good person,"" Matar said about the author in a 2022 New York Post story. ""He's someone who attacked Islam."" Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution. The attack took place some 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses was published. The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous. Sir Salman faced countless death threats and was forced into hiding for nine years after Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for the author's death due to the book. But in recent years, the author said he believed the threats against him had diminished. Just before the attack Sir Salman told a German magazine he felt his life was ""relatively normal"". The British-Indian novelist later detailed his experience and long road to recovery in a memoir called Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.",2025-05-18
CBS,Business,"How much could you save in taxes if the GOP bill is signed into law?
                  

          The greatest benefits would go to high-income households, while low-income families would see a much more modest boost, analyses show.
        

May 16",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-bill-one-big-beautiful-bill-impact-by-income-group/,"The White House on Friday touted a Republican-backed tax bill as delivering ""PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks."" Yet experts say the legislation would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder. If the bill is passed, households with more than $1 million in annual income would see their after-tax earnings rise by 4.3%, according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a public policy think tank. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost — their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, CBPP found. Other analyses have reached similar conclusions. The Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, forecasts that the bottom 20% of Americans would see a 0.6% increase in after-tax income under the House tax bill, compared with a 3.7% increase for the top 20%. The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after five Republican members of the House Budget Committee on Friday voted against advancing the measure, dubbed the ""one big, beautiful, bill,"" saying the legislation does not do enough to slash federal spending. Such projections don't include the impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households. Under the GOP bill, those services could face steep cuts, potentially bumping millions off Medicaid by adding work requirements and cutting federal funding provided to states to support the health care program. Those cuts could leave many low-income households worse off even after accounting for lower taxes, according to another analysis released Friday from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania research group that analyzes the fiscal impact of public policies. The bottom 20% of households, who earn up to about $17,000 annually, would see their after-tax incomes drop by $1,035 in 2026, including a reduction in government benefits, the nonpartisan group found. The top 0.1%, who earn at least $4.3 million per year, would get an annual after-tax boost of about $389,000, Penn Wharton said. The White House took issue with the CBPP and Penn Wharton analyses. ""Once again, the experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,"" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. He added, ""These experts should be embarrassed to share their 'expertise,' considering the egg still on their faces. MAGAnomics transcends conventional wisdom, and the President's One, Big, Beautiful Bill will continue to prove the haters wrong."" The White House pointed to an analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation that estimated the average tax bill would decline 11.1% in 2027 under the GOP legislation. The nonpartisan panel, which assess the impact of legislation for Congress, found that the biggest tax decrease would go to people earning $15,000 to $30,000, with a decline of 21.1%, while those earning more than $1 million would decline 8.6% Because low-income households spend a bigger share of their income on basics like food and clothing than wealthier Americans, they are likely to take a bigger financial hit from tariffs, experts including the nonpartisan Yale Budget Lab have said. That could effectively wipe out the benefits from the tax cuts, according to some analysts. If inflation rises as a result of higher tariffs and tax cuts, the bottom 20% of U.S. households would lose $100 per year, largely due to paying higher costs for consumer goods that are imported from other countries, the CBPP found. Because tariffs are taxes on imports paid by U.S. businesses, they typically pass on the cost of such duties to consumers by raising prices. ""If we add just the effects of the tariffs the Trump Administration has put in place, the plan would still boost the rich while leaving the lowest-income people worse off because their tax cuts are so small,"" Brendan Duke, senior director for federal fiscal policy at the CBPP, said in a post. Counting the impact of tariffs, the top 1% of households would still see their after-tax incomes increase by 3%, or almost $45,000, the think tank estimated. That analysis doesn't include the impact of cuts to services like Medicaid or food stamps. On Thursday, Walmart said it plans to hike prices this month to offset the cost of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration. As well as calling for deeper cuts in federal spending, the Republican lawmakers blocking the tax bill also want to move up work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, which under the current bill wouldn't kick in until 2029. Other Republicans want a bigger deduction cap on state and local taxes, known as SALT, that can be applied on people's federal tax returns. The bill increases the cap on the deduction from $10,000 to $30,000. But the bill's basic outline for cutting taxes isn't a focus of debate among Republicans, who are seeking to extend Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill would also add a host of other cuts, such as eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, while also providing a more generous standard deduction.

CBS,Business,"Moody's downgrades U.S. credit rating, citing rising government debt
                  

          Moody's lowered its rating on U.S. debt from Aaa to Aa1, pointing to sustained increase in federal debt and interest payments.
        

May 16",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-credit-rating-downgraded-by-moodys-loses-aaa-status/,"The U.S. credit rating was downgraded by Moody's Ratings on Friday, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The downgrade from the top rating of Aaa to Aa1 ""reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" the credit rating firm said in a statement on Friday. ""Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,"" Moody's added. Moody's also highlighted the environment of heightened policy uncertainty driven by Mr. Trump's evolving trade priorities. Moody's is the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade U.S. government debt. In August 2011, Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+, and in August 2023 Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating a notch from AAA to AA+. Moody's said it expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by ""increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending and relatively low revenue generation.'' ""Even Obama economists warned the Biden administration and congressional Democrats against recklessly wasting trillions on COVID 'stimulus' bills – spending that piled on our national debt, fueled runaway inflation, and forced the Fed to raise interest rates for everyday Americans,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement Friday to CBS News in response to the downgrade. ""The Trump administration and Republicans are focused on fixing Biden's mess by slashing the waste, fraud, and abuse in government and passing The One, Big, Beautiful Bill to get our house back in order. If Moody's had any credibility, they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded."" The credit downgrade came as the House Budget Committee on Friday rejected President Trump's domestic policy bill, which would extend tax cuts from his first term. If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act is extended, it would add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit (excluding interest payments) over the next decade, Moody's said Friday. The Congressional Budget Office projects that federal debt held by the public will rise from 100% of GDP to 118% in 2035. That would exceed a previous high of 106% in 1946. Despite the debt downgrade, Moody's changed its outlook on the U.S. from negative to stable. The credit agency said the U.S. ""retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the continued role of the U.S. dollar as global reserve currency."" Another strength is the country's track record of ""very effective monetary policy led by an independent Federal Reserve,"" Moody's said.

CBS,Business,"Trump says U.S. will set tariff rates for most nations within weeks
                  

          President Trump said his administration ""will be sending letters out"" in two to three weeks to alert other nations of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose.
        

May 16",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-set-rates-for-other-nations-within-weeks/,"President Trump on Friday said his administration will send letters that inform other nations of the tariff rates the U.S. will impose on imports, adding that ""it's not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us."" ""[W]e have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal, but you're not able to see that many countries,"" Mr. Trump said during a Friday business roundtable between the U.S. and United Arab Emirates. Mr. Trump said the letters will be sent by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, adding that the rates ""would be very fair, but we'll be telling people what they'll be paying to do business in the United States."" The Trump administration has been negotiating with the U.K., China and other major trading partners in recent weeks over his April 2 tariffs, which set historically high duties on imported goods for almost every country on the globe. U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, along with many small businesses, pay the tariffs on imports — not the nations that produce the goods — and those companies typically pass off the costs to American consumers in the form of higher prices. ""We expect the U.S.'s effective tariff rate to increase by about 13 [percentage points] this year to its highest level since the 1930s,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a May 14 research note. ""While the ultimate level and composition of tariffs remains uncertain, they will probably remain elevated for the foreseeable future."" Walmart on Thursday warned that it will start raising prices later this month due to the impact of U.S. tariffs. While Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would ease tariffs on Chinese imports for 90 days — taking the rate down from 145% to about 30% — it represents an increased business expense for American companies. ""We can control what we can control,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first-quarter earnings call yesterday. ""Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,"" he added. Mr. Trump has said he's rolling out the tariffs for a variety of reasons, including to spur domestic and foreign businesses to shift their manufacturing plants to the U.S. and revive American manufacturing jobs. On Friday, Mr. Trump touted announcements from some companies that have said they plan to invest in the U.S. ""[W]e're probably in the $12 to $13 trillion range of investments,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I think we're heading toward the $12 to $13 trillion between projects already announced, mostly announced, but some are going to be announced very shortly and literally, very shortly."" Still, many trade experts are skeptical that the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spark a major revival in U.S. manufacturing. Businesses typically decide to build new factories based on a number of other factors beyond tariffs, including labor, energy and transportation costs, tax rates, and the regulatory environment.

CBS,Business,"Why there's no tax break for Social Security benefits in the new tax bill
                  

          Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.
        

May 15",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-income-tax-benefits-trump-one-big-beautiful-bill/,"Republican-backed legislation now winding its way through the House includes a number of tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay, as well as sharply lowering lowering rates on corporations. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's suggestion last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits. ""Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,"" Mr. Trump said while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in the bill approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. If the measure passes the House, it would then move to the Senate. The bill would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions. The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said. Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained. Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older. Called an ""enhanced deduction for seniors,"" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older. Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients — or about 27 million people — pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration. ""I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes"" on their benefits, Freese said. Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold. Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue, according to the latest annual report from Social Security's board of trustees. Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy. Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added. The result would be ""automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,"" the institute noted. Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said. ""We viewed it as a bait and switch,"" she said. ""You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.""

CBS,Business,"Home electricity bills forecast to reach a 12-year high this summer
                  

          High temperatures and rising electricity costs could boost home energy bills by 6% this summer, a new report says.
        

May 16",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/electricity-bill-summer-2025-inflation-high-temperatures-neada/,"High temperatures projected across the U.S. summer could take a toll on Americans' budgets by driving up the price of keeping homes cool. Home electricity bills are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, up more than 6% from $737 in 2024 and marking a 12-year record, according a new analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The growing expense comes on the heels of a cold winter that drove up heating costs for many Americans, and as consumers continue to grapple with higher prices on everyday goods. Consumers are also increasingly expressing concerns about how tariffs could affect their day-to-day costs, Gallup polling has found. ""We found that it's going to be another expensive summer for air conditioning because temperatures will stay high, and electricity prices have been rising faster than inflation,"" energy economist Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch. The anticipated spike in residential electricity costs from June through September is due to the combination of rising cost of electricity, which is outpacing inflation, with higher temperatures, NEADA said. Those trends mean that households are not only expected to pay higher prices for electricity, but will likely consume more of it than they did last summer because of the need for more cooling. ""It's not just temperatures that are going up, but the cost of cooling is going up,"" Wolfe said. ""And when electricity prices go up, they tend to stay high. So even if temperatures moderate, your bill might go up because of the cost of electricity."" Energy costs eat up a larger share of low-income families' budgets compared to higher-earners. Low-income households spend roughly 8.6% of their incomes on energy costs, compared to 3% for those that are higher up the income ladder, according to NEADA. Worryingly, the lowest earners could struggle to afford to keep their homes cool, Wolfe noted. The most recent Census Household Pulse Survey found that 37% of low- and moderate-income households could not afford their energy bills for at least one month between April 2023 and April 2024. If those households find themselves in a financial crunch this summer, they may opt to turn off their air conditioning, which could pose serious health risks, noted Wolfe. ""Last winter was cold, so they're just getting over paying their heating bills, and are now facing higher summer cooling costs,"" Wolfe explained. ""And while people understand that if you don't use heat in the winter, your pipes will freeze, that won't happen in the summer."" Reluctance to turn on one's air conditioning can have adverse health effects like heat stroke. ""While this won't do damage to your building, it will do damage to you,"" Wolfe said. Public assistance programs haven't kept pace with the evolving climate, according to Wolfe. ""We're having heat waves that are lasting longer, and the systems in place to protect families have not kept up,"" he said. This summer's cooling cost forecast should be taken as a sign that state and federal assistance programs require modernization, according to Wolfe. Only 26 states offer summer cooling assistance to help Americans pay their bills. Thirty-three states have no protections in place to prevent utilities company from shutting off customers' access to electricity when they're behind on payments. Extreme heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, according to the National Weather Service. Wolfe says that taking steps to modernize your home can actually help households save money. For example, adding insulation to your house can help control energy bills. ""Families should start preparing for long-term extreme weather and think about the energy efficiency of their cooling systems,"" he said.

""We talked about a variety of things,"" Rubio told ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" in an interview airing Sunday. ""I wanted to get his readout on his view of how the talks went yesterday. They were not a complete waste of time."" The phone call between the countries' top diplomats occurred a day after Moscow and Kyiv held the first direct talks in three years. Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey after he proposed direct negotiations and instead sent a lower-level delegation. The talks in Istanbul Friday broke up after fewer than two hours without a ceasefire, although both sides agreed on exchanging 1,000 prisoners of war each. The United States — along with its European allies — have been pushing Russia and Ukraine for an end to the three-year war. President Trump, who has expressed frustration with the stalled talks and threatened to stiffen American sanctions unless progress is made toward a peace deal, said Saturday he will be speaking with Putin by phone Monday. That call will be followed by one with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump said. ""Are they tapping us along? Well, that's what we're trying to find out,"" Rubio told Brennan when asked if Russia and Ukraine are seeking to talk to ""buy time."" ""We'll find out pretty soon."" He added, ""On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So, there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to."" The secretary of state said he believes the only way that these talks will move forward is if Mr. Trump and Putin meet in person. He said Mr. Trump has publicly offered to meet one-on-one. ""The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date,"" Rubio said. ""But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as feasible."" The Vatican has made a ""very generous offer"" to host any peace talks. Rubio, who is in Rome to attend the Mass for the inauguration of Pope Leo XIV Sunday, said the Vatican would be a place that ""all parties would feel comfortable."" Leo, who was elected as the first U.S.-born pope on May 8, took up Pope Francis' call for peace in Ukraine in his first Sunday noon blessing as pope.

          Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the vice presidential nominee in 2024, made his remarks at the University of Minnesota's law school commencement ceremony.
        

14H ago",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/walz-calls-trump-a-tyrant/,"Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota criticized President Trump in a law school graduation speech Saturday, accusing the Republican president of creating a national emergency by repeatedly violating the rule of law. Walz, the vice presidential nominee in 2024, used his remarks at the University of Minnesota's law school commencement ceremony to call on graduates to stand up to abuses of power. Lawyers, he said, are ""our first and last line of defense."" ""Right now, more than any other time in my lifetime, we need you to live up to the oath that you're about to make. Because, I have to be honest with you: You are graduating into a genuine emergency,"" Walz told the crowd, which greeted him with loud applause. ""Every single day, the president of the United States finds new ways to trample rights and undermine the rule of law."" Walz pointed to Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, which includes deporting alleged gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador, questions about lack of due process and the offer of a gifted jet from the Qatari ruling family to the president. ""This is what the crumbling of rule of law looks like in real time. And it's exactly what the founders of this nation feared: A tyrant, abusing power to persecute scapegoats and enemies,"" he said. Since former Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Mr. Trump in November, Democrats have been debating which direction to take the party amid deep frustrations from Democratic voters that its leaders are failing to do enough to check the new administration. Walz is among a long list of potential 2028 candidates who have been traveling to early voting states. Others include Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who sharply criticized ""do-nothing"" Democrats last month for failing to oppose Mr. Trump. Pritzker, who is scheduled to headline a Minnesota Democratic dinner in June, drew attention in February when he used part of his joint budget and State of the State address to draw a parallel between Mr. Trump's rhetoric and the rise of Nazi Germany. This past week, former President Joe Biden's transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, returned to Iowa for a town hall where he criticized Mr. Trump's administration while demanding that Democrats make their agenda clear and reach out to people who disagree with them. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been hosting a high-profile podcast. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been drawing huge crowds to rallies across the country. Walz and Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland have scheduled stops in South Carolina at the end of May. In his commencement speech, Walz acknowledged his words were particularly pointed for a celebratory ceremony. ""Some would say, 'Boy, this is getting way too political for a commencement address.' But I would argue: I wouldn't be honoring my oath if I didn't address this head on,"" he said to applause and cheers. Later, he scoffed at some Democrats who have urged the party to focus on issues such as trade, where Mr. Trump is polling badly, instead of the rule of law. He also attacked ""feckless"" and ""cowardly"" big law firms that have acquiesced to Mr. Trump in the face of threats, with some offering millions in pro bono work and other benefits. ""It's a flagrant betrayal of the oath they took as lawyers,"" he said, urging graduates to refuse to work for or with those firms as they make their way into the workforce.",2025-05-18

          The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that will air on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" on May 18, 2025.
        

14H ago",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-face-the-nation-transcript-5-18-2025/,"The following is the transcript of an interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that will air on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" on May 18, 2025. MARGARET BRENNAN:  And joining us now is Secretary of State Marco Rubio from Rome. Mr. Secretary, you've had a very busy week. I know you have been at the Vatican, and they have offered to host a direct meeting between Ukraine and Russia. Given that Vladimir Putin was a no show at the talks he called for in Istanbul this past week, is there reason to believe that he will take up Pope Leo on the offer? SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think if you saw- again, I'm not a spokesperson for the Kremlin, but if you saw their statements, I believe yesterday, where they said that they would be open to such a meeting under the right conditions. So we'll wait and see if that's possible. Obviously, the Vatican has made a very generous offer to host anything, by the way, not just a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, but any meeting, including at a technical level, you know, any meetings that- that need to be hosted, they- they've expressed a willingness to do so. So it's a very generous offer that may be taken up on. I mean, it would be a site that all parties would feel comfortable. So hopefully we'll get to that stage where- where talks are happening on a regular basis and that the Vatican will have the opportunity to be one of the options. MARGARET BRENNAN:  The Russian Foreign Ministry is saying that you initiated a call to your Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, on Saturday. What was that about? Are you talking about lining up that face-to-face meeting between President Putin and President Trump? SEC. RUBIO: Well, we talked about a variety of things. We did talk about- I wanted to get his readout on his view of how the talks went yesterday. There- they were not a complete waste of time. For example, there were 1,000 prisoners that are going to be exchanged, and that, from a humanitarian standpoint, is very positive. He explained to me that they are going to be pre- preparing a document outlining their requirements for a cease-fire that would then lead to broader negotiations. So obviously, the Ukrainian side is going to be working on their own proposal, and hopefully that will be forthcoming soon. And if that does happen, and the proposal that comes forward from the Russian side and- and for that matter, from the Ukrainian side, are proposals that are serious and viable, then there's been real progress, and we can work off of that. So we'll have to wait and see. But he wanted me to know, and he communicated in our call, that they are- their side will be working on a series of ideas and requirements that they would have in order to move forward with a cease-fire and further negotiations. So we'll await that, and hopefully it's one- it's a document that is close enough to what the Ukrainians want to be able to get to that point and maybe work out those differences. MARGARET BRENNAN:  You've said repeatedly it's just a matter of days, though, in terms of the waning patience that the U.S. has for this diplomacy to succeed. So are- are they just tapping you along, as President Trump has said? Are they just seeking to talk- Are they just seeking to continue to talk to buy time? SEC. RUBIO:  Well, that's what we're testing. And that's what we'll know. Look, at the end of the day what I've said, and it's happening now, we're no longer flying all over the world trying to set up meetings. We're responding to meetings that are set up and we're willing- we always said we're willing to do whatever it takes to bring them together if the opportunities present themselves. So I think your question is, are they tapping us along? Well, that's what we're trying to find out. We'll find out pretty soon. They met last- yesterday or the day before in Turkey. From that they agreed they're going to exchange paper on ideas that get to a cease-fire. If those papers have ideas on them that are realistic and rational, then I think we know we've made progress. If those papers, on the other hand, have requirements in them that we know are unrealistic, then we'll have a different assessment. So, we're going to try to find that out. And there's a combination here. On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to. So we don't want to be involved in this process of just endless talks, there has to be some progress, some movement forward. And if at the end of this, in the next few days, we get a document produced by both sides, and it shows that both sides are being- making concessions and being realistic and rational in their approach, then I think we can feel good about continuing to remain engaged. If, on the other hand, what we see is not very productive, perhaps we'll have a different assessment. I also agree that ultimately, one of the things that could help break this log jam, perhaps the only thing that can, is a direct- direct conversation between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. And he's already openly expressed a desire and a belief that that needs to happen, and- and hopefully that'll be worked out soon as well. MARGARET BRENNAN:  You're planning on that? SEC. RUBIO:  Well, I don't know. We're- we're certainly made the offer. The president's made that offer already publicly. The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date. But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as- as feasible. I think the Russian side has also expressed a willingness to do it. And so, now it's just a question of bringing them- bringing everyone together, and figuring out where and when and that meeting will happen and what it will be about. MARGARET BRENNAN:  Yeah, I- I want to move on to other topics. But lastly, your- your Senate- former senate colleague, Lindsey Graham, was next to you in that meeting with the Ukrainian foreign minister. He has a- he has a veto-proof majority on this bill to put sanctions on Russia. How quickly do you want the option for more sanctions on Russia? Or are you asking him to wait? SEC. RUBIO:  No, we're not- look, the Senate is going to act, ultimately. I mean, I think in the past, we've act- asked to give us a little time to see if we can make some progress on our talks. But we've also been pretty clear with the Russian side for weeks now, going back six or seven weeks. We've been communicating to the Russian side that this effort was- was being undertaken. That we anticipated that when all was said and done, it would have close to 80 cosponsors in the Senate, and I imagine a comparable percentage of support in the House, that that was an effort we couldn't stop and don't control, that ultimately, Congress and particularly the Republicans in the House and Senate, have tried to give the president space and time to negotiate something here. But we've- we've advised the Russians repeatedly now for almost two months that this was coming if no progress was made. So I think that's just coming to fruition now. And it's one of the- one of the things that I confirmed, again, being with Lindsey Graham this week in Turkey, is they're now up to 77. He thinks they could get close to 80 or more. And that's just- that's just a fact, and something we've told the Russians about for weeks was coming. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move on to another part of the world. You've been very involved in the administration's efforts to crack down on this Venezuelan gang, TdA, that has been designated as a terror group by the U.S. Do you accept the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang is not a proxy force of the Maduro government? That was the National Intelligence Council assessment. SEC. RUBIO:  Yeah, that's their assessment. They're wrong. In fact, the FBI agrees with me that they are. We- we- the FBI agrees that not only is Tren de Aragua exported by the Venezuelan regime, but in fact, if you go back and see a Tren de Aragua member, all the evidence is there, and it's growing every day, was actually contracted to murder an opposition member, I believe, in Chile a few months ago. So one of the warnings out there by the FBI is not simply that Tren de Aragua are- are a terrorist organization, but one that has already been operationalized, to murder a- to murder a- an- an opposition member in another country. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's a different thing than being a proxy force controlled by the Maduro government. Part of this is at the heart of the legal arguments the administration is having over its ability to continue to deport suspected gang members. That's why this assessment is so key. You completely reject that intelligence-- SEC. RUBIO:  There- there-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --community finding? SEC. RUBIO:  Yeah, I agree 100 percent with the FBI's finding. This is a prison gang that the Venezuelan government has actively encouraged to leave the country. A prison gang that, in some cases, they've been in cooperation- and by the way, Tren de Aragua members that have been returned to Venezuela on some of these planes that have gone back have been greeted like heroes at the airport. So we have no doubt, I have no doubt and the FBI has made clear, I mean, this is the gang that they hired in order to- to murder an opposition member in another country. So they- they- there's no doubt in our mind, and in my mind, and in the FBI's assessment that this is a group that the regime in Venezuela uses, not just to try to destabilize the United States, but to project power, like they did by murdering a member of the opposition in Chile. MARGARET BRENNAN:  South Africa's president is traveling to the United States this week to meet with President Trump. The administration has prioritized bringing some white South Africans, Afrikaners, to the United States, despite the increased restrictions on refugees. President Trump claims there's a genocide underway in South Africa. That's a legal determination, the State Department would make it. Are you trying to determine that now? SEC. RUBIO: I would determine that these people are having their properties taken from them. You can- they can call it whatever they want, but these are people that, on the basis of their race, are having their properties taken away from them, and their lives being threatened and, in some cases, killed. These are people that applied and made these claims in their applications and seek to come to the United States in search of- of refuge. I- we've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad. Well, here's an example where we're doing that. So I don't understand why people are criticizing it. I think people should be celebrating it, and I think people should be supporting it-- (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well is there evidence-- SEC. RUBIO: If in fact as many claim, they are in favor-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --of a genocide that you have? (END CROSSTALK) SEC. RUBIO: I think there's evidence, absolutely, that people have been murdered, that people have been forcibly removed from their properties, both by the government, in some cases because of a law they passed, but also because of independent groups encouraged by political parties inside of South- inside of South Africa. So, listen, to move here from half a world away and leave behind the only homeland you've ever known, that's not something people do lightly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: No. SEC. RUBIO: --especially people who have spent generations farming their land and developing their property. That's not something that you take lightly and do. These people are doing it for a reason. So we welcome them to the United States, and I think there may be more coming soon. MARGARET BRENNAN:  We will stand by to see if that determination of genocide is made. I want to ask you about the Middle East. The president says he wants to end wars, but Israel's prime minister has said he is expanding this ground operation inside of Gaza, the IDF says is to seize strategic areas. Does the U.S. fully support expanding this war? SEC. RUBIO:  We expand the destruction of Hamas, the ending of Hamas. We support a future for the people of Gaza that is free of Hamas and full of opportunity. That's what we support. And this is a group that came across on October 7 and carried out one of the most vile series of attacks, kidnappings, rapes, murders and hostage taking that we've ever seen. That's what we support. Now that said, we also support an end of the conflict, a cease-fire. We don't want people obviously suffering as they have, and we blame Hamas for that, but nonetheless, they're suffering. And so we are actively engaged, even as I speak to you now, we are actively engaged in trying to figure out if there is a way to get more hostages out through some cease-fire type mechanism. We're not going to do anything to undermine Israel and its security, but by the same token, if there is a possibility here to find a way forward that frees more hostages, including those who are alive, but also the bodies to their relatives, and potentially bring about an end to this war in a way that puts the people of Gaza on a pathway of peace and prosperity and being free of Hamas, we're going to explore that. We think we've made some progress, but there's more work to be done. Ambassador Witkoff is working on that on an hourly basis. It's something we're all very focused on and continue to be very supportive of. And I hope we'll have good news soon in that regard, but I think some impediments remain. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you asking Israel to slow down this military push? And the Qatari prime minister told Fox News that there was a deal being put together for all hostages, or many hostages, to be released after Edan Alexander, that American-Israeli was released recently, but then the Israeli military bombed a hospital, killing 70 civilians, and everything went sideways. Is that your understanding of what happened-- SEC. RUBIO: Well, I would say that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --it was this lack of care of collateral damage? SEC. RUBIO:  No, I- the way I would characterize it is that this war could end immediately. And Israel's made that clear, it can end immediately if Hamas surrenders and gives up their weapons and demilitarizes and releases all the hostages, including the deceased ones. If they did that, this conflict would end. That's been true from the very beginning. It's been true for months now. They're the ones that have chosen not to accept that offer. That said, we continue to work and do everything we can through diplomatic channels and private means to bring about an end to this conflict in a way that ends Hamas and provides the people of Gaza the opportunity at a prosperous and peaceful future that also ensures Israel's security. So we're working on that, and we've never stopped working on that. We've never stopped taking efforts to make that possible. And that continues. Even as I speak to you now, there are people working on that. So we're going to continue to do that and that's the outcome we want to see. And hopefully, the sooner the better. MARGARET BRENNAN:  Well, the president has said Prime Minister Netanyahu didn't want to end the war. So the views are quite-- SEC. RUBIO: Well, I think what the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --in contrast. SEC. RUBIO: Yeah- no- what the president's- no, no. I think what the president is saying is he doesn't want to end the war until Hamas is defeated. This is a group that is a threat- if an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire. And that is the view of- there is no future. There can be no peaceful and prosperous Gaza as long as Hamas governs it by rule of arms. And that's a- that's a fundamental truth. Now that doesn't mean that there isn't some way that we can achieve that through a cease-fire and some peace mechanism, and that's what we're trying to accomplish here. Ending Hamas, ending its governance of Gaza, ending the conflict, freeing all of the hostages, including the bodies of those who have passed away and been killed and murdered by the Hamas terrorists, and then beginning the work of a future for Gaza and also of ensuring Israel's security. That's always been our goal. That remains our goal, and that's what we continue to be focused on. But in the absence of that such agreement, we anticipate that, you know, Israel will continue forward with their operations. But that doesn't mean we stopped working on trying to achieve a peaceful outcome that also protects Israel's security and ends Hamas's governance of Gaza, so that Gaza can have a free and prosperous future moving forward. That's what the president wants to see as the end goal here. That is the end goal, and that's what we're working on through every means at our disposal. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said that Iran is, in your view, a threshold nuclear state, and we're at a critical moment. The U.S. and Iran are talking again. Can you clarify what the U.S. policy is here? Is the bottom line that Iran cannot enrich any uranium, even if it is at low levels for civilian purposes? Do they need to fully dismantle the program? SEC. RUBIO: Well, look, if you're able to enrich at any level you've now are basically able to enrich at weapons grade very quickly. I mean, that's just a fundamental fact, and everyone knows it, and that was the problem with the Obama deal. But the end goal here is simple, Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. And the president's preference, because he doesn't like war, the president's preference is to achieve that through a peaceful negotiation. In fact, the president's preference is not- not only that Iran not pursue nuclear weapons, but that Iran be a rich, peaceful and prosperous country where its people can be happy. He wants them to have a better future. He has said this, he's a builder, not a bomber. That's what he views himself as, and that's what he is. He's a president that wants peace, and so he's offered that route, and that's one we hope the Iranians will take. But he's been very clear, Iran is never going to have the capability. They're never going to have a nuclear weapon. It's not going to happen. And we hope that that is achieved, that outcome is achieved through peaceful, diplomatic means, and that's what we're engaged on. We're not going to negotiate it in the media, because it makes it difficult to get an outcome. But that is the ultimate goal here, is to have an Iran that does not have a nuclear weapon or the ability to threaten its neighbors, particularly Israel. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I know you have a busy schedule. Thank you for your time this morning. SEC. RUBIO: Thank you.",2025-05-18

8H ago",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-walmart-prices-tariffs-response/,"President Trump ripped into Walmart, saying on social media Saturday that the retail giant should ""eat the tariffs"" instead of blaming the duties on imported goods imposed by his administration for its increased prices. Walmart on Thursday warned that everything from bananas to children's car seats could increase in price despite the softer tariffs on China. ""We can control what we can control,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on the company's first quarter earnings call Thursday. ""Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,"" he added. The price hikes are expected to go into effect later this month. As Mr. Trump has jacked up import taxes, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for those taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses. In a Truth Social post on Sunday, the president lashed out at Walmart – which employs some 1.6 million people in the United States – and said the company should sacrifice its profits for the sake of his economic agenda. Mr. Trump says his economic plan will eventually lead to more domestic jobs in manufacturing. ""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,"" Trump posted. ""Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ""EAT THE TARIFFS,"" and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!"" A spokesperson for Walmart told CBS News on Saturday that it has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and ""we won't stop."" ""We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,"" the spokesperson said. The threat by the Republican president reflected the increasingly awkward series of choices that many major American companies face as a result of his tariffs, from deteriorating sales to the possibility of incurring Mr. Trump's wrath. Mr. Trump has similarly warned domestic automakers not to raise their prices, even though outside analyses say his tariffs would raise production costs. In April, McMillon was among the retail executives who met with Mr. Trump at the White House to discuss tariffs and potential negative outcomes. But the Trump administration went forward despite warnings and has attacked other companies, such as Amazon and Apple, that are struggling with the disruptions to their supply chains. Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey said he thinks $350 car seats made in China will soon cost an additional $100, a 29% price increase. ""We're wired to keep prices low, but there's a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,"" he told The Associated Press on Thursday after the company reported strong first-quarter sales. Many U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of tariffs, as consumers curtail spending. The administration recently ratcheted down its 145% tariffs on China to 30% for a 90-day period. Trump has placed tariffs as high as 25% on Mexico and Canada due to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, harming the relationship with America's two largest trading partners. There is a universal baseline tariff of 10% for most countries as Trump promises to reach trade deals in the coming weeks, all while insisting he intends to preserve the tariffs as a revenue source. The framework agreement with the United Kingdom would largely keep the 10% tariff rate in place. Trump has also placed import taxes on autos, steel and aluminum and plans to do so on pharmaceutical drugs, among other products.",2025-05-18
CBS,Politics,"Combat sport clubs used to recruit for white nationalist hate group, report says
                  

          Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups are fueling the expansion of extremist groups in the U.S., and control at least a dozen clubs nationwide.
        

15H ago",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/combat-sport-clubs-boost-recruitment-white-nationalist-hate-group-report/,"Combat sport clubs have been used to boost recruitment for a white nationalist hate group, according to a report released by the legal advocacy organization Southern Poverty Law Center. The report tracks the efforts of the Patriot Front — one of the most visible groups in the white nationalist movement, formed following the deadly 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 — and their focus on recruiting new members through Active Clubs. These clubs are smaller, looser networks of white supremacist groups, where members train in mixed martial arts. Through sport, they bond over white nationalist ideologies, SPLC said. The clubs also maintain a robust online presence to encourage young men to become radicalized. Patriot Front is using these groups to expand their reach while maintaining a low profile, the report said, to evade researchers and law enforcement. ""It serves as a way to hide some of the Patriot Front's movements,"" said Jeff Tischauser, the SPLC report's author and a researcher at the not-for-profit legal advocacy organization. Patriot Front and other white nationalist groups are fueling the expansion of extremist groups in the U.S. – and control at least a dozen clubs nationwide. Since 2023, there has been a 14% increase in hate groups, according to the SPLC, which says it tracks 1,430 hate and antigovernment groups across the country. Active Clubs have had a presence since 2023 in at least 34 states, including Arizona, California, Ohio, Kansas, Montana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Florida, according to the Counter Extremism Project. The groups host training sessions, create propaganda videos and participate in demonstrations and flash rallies, according to experts. They push male supremacy ideology, share workout selfies and encourage each other to reach peak physicality in preparation for marches or possible future conflicts, experts say. Robert Rundo, the founder of a white supremacist group based in Southern California, is credited with introducing the idea of Active Clubs, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In 2021, Rundo began hosting a podcast called ""Active Club Podcast,"" where he and his co-host encouraged listeners to establish their own clubs. He hawked what he called ""white nationalism 3.0"" — a more local, decentralized approach to the white nationalist movement. Rundo was arrested in Romania in 2023 after the U.S. requested his extradition on federal rioting charges. He was sentenced to two years and effectively received a time-served sentence, being released in December 2024. The shift to ""white nationalism 3.0"" is similar to leaderless resistance concepts across the far right ecosystem, said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. ""I think a lot of these groups really function more like brands,"" he said. Audio messages and a leaked internal memo obtained by the SPLC confirmed direct affiliations between Patriot Front and certain Active Clubs. The founder of a Texas active club was berated for recruiting ""non-European"" members. ""Is our organization something you are totally committed to, or are you going to be the active club guy doing your own thing?"" The Patriot Front member asked, according to the SPLC report. The new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand, the SPLC says, after years of controversies stemming from various lawsuits and acts of vandalism. In January, Patriot Front was ordered to pay $2.7 million in damages to a Black musician the group attacked during a march in Boston in 2022. In February, a settlement was reached between Patriot Front and two North Dakota nonprofits over allegations that the group intimidated immigrant business owners. Patriot Front has also faced scrutiny from within the right-wing movement. ""In some sections of this larger far right, Patriot Front is branded as federal agents,"" Tischauser said. ""So to avoid that accusation, they use Active Clubs and start trying to groom people into Patriot Front membership from there."" The conspiracy theory even gained enough traction on social media to reach Elon Musk. Last year, he posted on X, ""This does seem odd. Why no mask removal after arrest?"" in reaction to a post of Patriot Front members being detained, where an X user dubbed the group ""Fed Front."" The conspiracy that FBI agents pose as right-wing activists goes beyond Patriot Front. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that a quarter of Americans believe the FBI instigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The FBI said in a statement to CBS News Saturday, ""The FBI investigates individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and other criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security. Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity."" CBS News has reached out to Patriot Front's founder and leader, Thomas Rosseau, via email. Lewis said that there has been a mainstreaming of conspiracy theories and hateful beliefs once confined to neo-Nazi forums and considered to be fringe. ""Today, you have the richest man in the world, members of Congress tweeting this out, as if it's like a real thing that's happening,"" Lewis said. ""That just broadens out the aperture of disaffected young, predominantly white men who are looking for someone to blame, something to blame."" Since these clubs are scattered, unaffiliated entities, Patriot Front has faced challenges in its recruitment efforts. ""They want to project themselves as much larger and much more serious than they actually are,"" said Lewis.",2025-05-18

          Bruce Springsteen, a long-standing and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England.
        

May 16",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bruce-springsteen-land-of-hopes-and-dreams-tour-trump-truth-social-post/,"Bruce Springsteen gave his latest stinging criticism of President Trump and his administration, calling them ""treasonous"" and ""incompetent"" to kick off the first show of his British tour this week. The president responded in a Truth Social post that included criticism of the rocker's skin and telling him to ""keep his mouth shut"" until returning to the U.S. Springsteen, a long and prominent supporter of Democratic presidential candidates, made his remarks at a concert in Manchester, England, on Wednesday during the first of his ""Land of Hope and Dreams"" tour. ""The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock 'n' roll in dangerous times,"" he said. ""In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration."" The 75-year-old rocker, who later shared a transcript and video of his remarks on his website and YouTube channel, asked supporters of democracy to ""raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!"" Throughout the concert, Springsteen accused Mr. Trump and his administration of authoritarianism, rolling back civil rights, blocking free speech and ""taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers."" ""They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just and plural society,"" Springsteen said. ""They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom."" On Friday, Mr. Trump responded on his social media platform, saying that the rocker is ""just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country."" He added: ""Springsteen is 'dumb as a rock,' and couldn't see what was going on, or could he (which is even worse!)? This dried out 'prune' of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that's just 'standard fare.' Then we'll all see how it goes for him!"" This is not the first time Springsteen has aimed at Mr. Trump and his policies. When he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, Springsteen called Mr. Trump ""the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime."" ""Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does than at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,"" the rock star said in a short video shared on social media. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Springsteen called Mr. Trump a ""moron."" When Mr. Trump was running for reelection in 2020, Springsteen told The Atlantic he didn't know ""if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship."" Later this summer, Springsteen will also release a new album collection that will include dozens of ""never-before-heard"" songs from previously unreleased records.

          Singer Chris Brown has been arrested in England for allegedly hitting someone with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.
        

May 15",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-brown-arrested-uk-alleged-attack-london-club/,"Singer Chris Brown was arrested Thursday in England for allegedly hitting someone with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023. The Metropolitan Police did not name Brown but said it took a 36-year-old into custody at a Manchester hotel on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. Under British law, police cannot name suspects before charges are filed. The Sun, which first reported the story, said producer Abe Diaw told them Sunday that he was hospitalized after Brown beat him in an unprovoked attack at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in London in February 2023. Diaw told the Sun that Brown allegedly hit him over the head with a bottle before punching and kicking him as he lay on the floor. The tabloid said it became aware Brown was in the U.K. on Wednesday and called police to find out if he was under arrest. The newspaper said Met officers then traveled to Manchester and made the arrest. Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Diaw said Brown, who was on a U.K. tour at the time, cracked him on the head with a bottle and punched and kicked him on the floor. The producer has filed a 12 million pound ($16 million) lawsuit against the singer. Brown, often called by his nickname Breezy, burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005 and has become a major hitmaker over the years with notable songs such as ""Run It,"" ""Kiss Kiss"" and ""Without You."" He won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for ""F.A.M.E."" then earned his second gold trophy in the same category for ""11:11 (Deluxe)"" earlier this year. Brown has a history of legal issues dating back to his felony conviction in the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. He pleaded guilty to felony assault at the time. In 2014, Brown pleaded guilty to hitting a man outside a Washington, D.C., hotel. In 2024, Brown, along with his paid entourage, allegedly beat several men who attended his concert in Texas. Earlier this year, Brown sued Warner Bros. Discovery for defamation over labeling the singer as an abuser in the 2024 documentary ""Chris Brown: A History of Violence."" The singer is launching an international tour next month with artists Jhene Aiko, Summer Walker and Bryson Tiller, opening with a European leg before starting North America shows in July.",2025-05-18

On Tuesday, the group posted on the San Francisco subreddit that they buried the chest somewhere in the city. ""You're looking for a 22 pound chest worth over $10,000. It's brimming with gleaming ingots, currency, and San Francisco artifacts. About half the value is in gold,"" the organizers said. The post, which quickly became viral, linked to their website featuring a poem containing several clues: ""Eighteen Bold letters, Preserved  In a clearing, sight a dark room's  view of brave surfers reeling From dry ruin's gate to solar's tall  mast, chart a historic cross -   the start of one's path To trace the true route, venture  only at night: to be certain of   bearing, you'll need pack a light In the steadfast basin, where feet part   and agree, dig a shovel's depth   down-you'll find the treasure you seek"" On Wednesday, NPR's All Things Considered reported that three friends, identified as Austin Theriault, TJ Lee and Erik Bahri, found the treasure Tuesday evening. The group told the public radio program that the prize was buried just off a trail in the Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve. They also revealed the contents inside the chest, which included a gold nugget, silver and copper coins, baseball cards featuring Giants slugger Barry Bonds, and a ticket to the Golden Gate International Exposition that took place in 1939. In a follow up Reddit post, the group that buried the treasure expressed surprise at how fast the items were found. ""Well, that went A LOT aster than anyone anticipated.

Now, Tiny Desk has a radio show hosted by Bobby Carter and Anamaria Sayre, airing on public radio stations and online. ""It was a long time coming,"" Carter said. ""I think that we have such a storied history now. I think there's such a history of, you know Tiny Desk started as one thing, and it has turned into this cultural phenomenon."" The radio show, which launched last month, showcases the performances and behind-the-scenes stories of the Tiny Desk concerts. ""If you haven't seen the show, we're trying to paint the picture for you, and it'll lead you to the show … because there's so much of a backstory. There's a unique story with every single show,"" Carter said about the reason behind the radio show. The series focuses on bringing in diverse artists of different genres, revealing even some major artists are nervous to perform. ""You get to see these massive artists as human beings at the end of the day. Some of the greatest artists in the world, they're stripped down to their core, which is just being a human,"" Carter said. The two hosts added that it's the ability to connect people all around the world that has helped to make Tiny Desk concerts and now the radio show successful. ""The way that a singer hit the same note might hit someone in Tennessee and Nigeria and Argentina, you don't know. So it's like you're connecting with the world whether you know it or not, and I think that people can feel that when they watch it in the way artists get intimate,"" said Sayre. While people tune in worldwide, in the small space, the crowd is primarily NPR staff. ""When you hear that crowd noise, there is energy in the room because you're right there, face to face. The artists, they feel that and they feed off of that. It's special for them,"" Sayre said. Recently, one of their biggest crowds was for when Bad Bunny performed. Carter and Sayre credit their impactful shows to their intimate settings. ""Stripping all that stuff away, that's when you see what they really can do … And we challenge the artist and we present them in a new way,"" Carter said. When asked what's next, Carter said it's up to his colleagues, ""they're going to take what I've been doing for a long time and a lot of my other colleagues, they're going to take it to whatever is next.""

The Telegraph,Business,Hundreds of Poundland stores to close under rescue deal,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/05/17/poundland-stores-risk-closure-thousands-of-jobs-threatened/,"Thousands of jobs also at risk as bidders finalise takeover proposals Copy link twitter facebook whatsapp email Copy link twitter facebook whatsapp email Copy link twitter facebook whatsapp email Copy link twitter facebook whatsapp email Thousands of high street jobs are at risk in a Poundland rescue deal that could trigger sweeping store closures. Bidders for the beleaguered retailer have identified as many as 200 loss-making stores that could be ditched as they put the finishing touches to takeover proposals this weekend. Formal offers are scheduled to be tabled on Monday, with a handful of investors still in the running. Industry sources said the discount chain was unlikely to survive without a large number of store closures, leaving another hole in the British high street. Poundland employs 15,000 people across a total of 825 UK shops. It is understood that any new owner would look to jettison as much as a quarter of the estate within weeks of taking control. Turnaround firms Hilco, Modella Capital, and Gordon Brothers are understood to be among a handful of shortlisted bidders. Pepco put Poundland up for sale in March as its fortunes plummeted, unveiling the move alongside a plan to buy back €200m (£168m) of its own stock. Its shares, which are listed on the Warsaw stock market, leapt as much as 11pc on the news. Despite generating revenues of more than €2bn in 2024, Pepco bosses said Poundland had been a “drag on the group’s financial performance – with lower revenue growth, lower gross margins, higher costs to operate, and consequently, lower profitability and returns on invested capital”. Rachel Reeves’s National Insurance tax raid had also aggravated the situation, the company said, as it piled “further pressure to Poundland’s cost base”. Months earlier, Pepco had slashed Poundland’s value by nearly £650m, as it blamed a “significant decline in performance” and spiralling costs. Under new owners, closures are expected to be accompanied by a significant cash injection to help return Poundland to profitability. Analysts estimate it will require tens of millions of pounds to spearhead the turnaround. The chain will also need a fresh debt package as its current lenders seek to get out. Prospective backers anticipate having to immediately pump in between £70m and £100m in order to stabilise the company. Though Poundland is part of Polish-based Pepco Group, its fate is ultimately in the hands of a pack of Wall Street hedge funds, which bailed out Pepco’s former South African owner Steinhoff in 2021. The US investment firms, which are thought to include the $38bn fund Silver Point, stepped in after Steinhoff defaulted on billions of pounds of debt. Retail sources have pointed to a move away from Poundland’s “everything’s a pound” slogan almost a decade ago as a contributing factor in its decline. Products have since been priced between 50p and £5 instead. The company has also admitted that an attempt to save costs by cutting back on suppliers backfired. “It became clear as the year progressed that both the planning and execution of this implementation had shortcomings, with gaps in clothing and general merchandise for the UK customer, impacting revenues and profitability during the year,” the company said in December. Pepco’s owners also include Davidson Kempner, which manages nearly $40bn (£30bn) of funds, and has seized control of American retailers J Crew and Neiman Marcus through so-called “loan to own”. In both, it exchanged debt for equity via Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Hedge funds swooped on Steinhoff in 2017 after the company owned up to financial irregularities, hoovering up its bonds and bank debt. They later converted their loans into a majority stake.
