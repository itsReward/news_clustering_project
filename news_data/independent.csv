Independent,Business,BlackRock’s billions show it’s not all gloom for UK business,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/stock-markets-blackrock-interest-rates-uk-b2739490.html,"Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism, as Karl Matchett reports I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The mood around UK business has ranged from cautious to desperate in the past few months as the economy battles inflation, tax grabs, rising labour costs and the prospects of US tariffs. Add in constant political pressures giving a bleak outlook and the stock market plummeting in early April on the back of those tariffs, and UK plc could be forgiven for thinking 2025 might become a year to forget. But perhaps all is not as bad as it was beginning to appear, with some important signs giving relief and optimism to some businesses who got a share price backing boost thanks to the world’s biggest investor, BlackRock, building stakes in multiple companies. And the most imminent boost will be a cut to interest rates. The Bank of England meets on 8 May and a 0.25 per cent cut appears all but guaranteed at this stage. And back-to-back rates cuts are entirely possible, bringing the Bank Rate down to 4 per cent by summer. It would be the first time since March 2023 that the interest rate returns to that level, easing costs for business owners with debt and perhaps allowing more consideration to investment on projects and other spending which could spark opportunities for the growth the economy desperately needs. Some businesses already look well-positioned to capture that growth, believes Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock. “[The company has] allocated more capital back to the UK tactically now with the belief that in the short run, the new administration is trying to tackle some of the hard issues,” Mr Fink toldThe Times. “I think the prime minister is articulating the needs of what we have to do. I have more confidence in the UK economy today than I did a year ago.” Pointing to some of the financial institutions that had seen their share price hammered this year as the FTSE 100 dropped along with other major stock markets, Mr Fink explained how BlackRock had taken stakes in different sectors in the belief the selloff was overdone. “So many of the UK stocks discounts were too deep, especially like in the banking system. Look at the rebound in the valuations of NatWest and Lloyds and how they bounced. We added to our positions across the board with the idea that we believe the market was discounting too much negativity. And we believe the negativity was probably not warranted,” he said. Having seen a significant drop from 3 April onwards, the FTSE 100 - the biggest firms on the London Stock Exchange - have bounced back somewhat and now remain up more than two per cent since the start of 2025, even if they have collectively not reached March’s high points. Interest rate drops - while affecting households in terms of mortgages, savings accounts and so on - also impact investing. That is in part due to lower guaranteed returns from cash or like-cash holdings, meaning more risk may be taken on in the form of stock market equities. Rising share prices help improve investor and business confidence, while consumers may then benefit from having more money in their own pockets if rate drops mean they pay less on mortgages and other debt. There are further positives in other sectors. Retail sales rose almost half a percent in the UK during March, and that came ahead of April when the rise to minimum wage kicked in meaning more money in some workers’ pockets. Jacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said: “Glimpses of warmer weather and improving consumer confidence meant retail sales continued its upward trend in March. Sales volumes rose for the third consecutive month, reaching their highest level since July 2022. The first quarter of 2025 suggests consumer spending is slowly starting to return, which should provide some reason for optimism in the retail sector.” Then there’s analysis from Barclays, showing both wage growth easing and contraction in employment. Both of these factors will further ease pressure on the Bank of England when it comes to deciding rates cuts. Small wins they might seem, and with little impact of individuals, but as we so often see in businesses, it’s those small wins adding up continuously which lead to the potential to outperform. Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism.

Independent,Business,Why Tesla’s fall forced Musk to step back from DOGE,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/tesla-elon-musk-doge-profits-share-price-stock-b2737802.html,"A 71 per cent drop in profits and tanking share price have forced Elon Musk to cut down his time as Trump’s costcutter-in-chief. Alicja Hagopian and Karl Matchett explore what happened I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice At the start of the year, Tesla’s share price was at an all-time high. Elon Musk, owner of the electric vehicle giant, was coasting on the win of his ally Donald Trump, and investors were hedging their bets that soon-to-be-President Trump would enact policies in favour of Tesla and the billionaire’s other companies. But with an astronomical fall in share price, tanking sales and shrinking profits, the reality for Tesla has been far different – and much of it is tied to Musk’s public-facing role in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla stock once made up the majority of Musk’s wealth, but now it is reporting huge drops in profit. The decision to step away from DOGE may show that Musk is not immune to Tesla’s downfall. Within one month of Musk’s appointment to DOGE, Tesla shares were down 16.5 per cent. Within two, Tesla’s share price was down 45 per cent from when Trump came into office. And Musk himself has lost an estimated $149 billion in wealth since taking the helm at DOGE; at $301 billion compared to $449 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Tesla’s share price problems have been far from cosmetic. The business is facing significant headwinds, not least because of the intertwined reputation with its notorious leader. In January and February, Tesla sales in Europe saw sudden dips, of 45 per cent and 39 per cent respectively year-on-year - despite steady growth in the European electric vehicle (EV) market. The numbers behind this week’s latest earnings reports are, as expected, not pretty. Quarterly profits of $409m contrasted starkly with last year’s $1.4bn figure for the same three months - and the 71 per cent drop represents the company’s lowest quarterly profits since 2020. Actual vehicle sales reported this month were down 13 per cent to a little over a third of a million across the January to March quarter, with notable declines in China and parts of the US, while revenue of $19.3bn fell short of forecasts by more than $2bn and operating margins fell to 2.1 per cent. “Earnings margin of 2.1 per cent is the lowest since Tesla approached break-even in 2019,” said Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “Free cash flow dipped to $660 million, but did not enter negative territory as capital expenditures were nearly halved compared to the prior year due to reduced investments. “Tesla has [also] effectively removed its growth guidance for this year, no longer promising a return to growth in 2025.” Additional factors affecting sales include competition from China’s BYD (Build Your Dreams), which undercuts Tesla on price, while frequent recalls of Tesla vehicles may also be doing little to boost confidence in the brand. But it is impossible to ignore a major factor impacting its brand: Musk’s growing unpopularity. Musk has made no secret of his increasingly controversial political viewpoints. From accusations of a nazi salute at the inauguration, to criticising Volodmyr Zelensky as “evil” over the war in Ukraine, it is easy to see how his actions have ruffled feathers. As a result, a string of attacks have targeted Teslas in Europe and the US over the past few months, with clear anti-Musk messages. Tesla owners have faced threats to sell their cars over “Nazi Extremism” in California, while even in the UK, campaign groups have applied pressure against Tesla cars and charging points. Tesla shareholders are pushing back against Musk’s alignment with Trump; his decision to step partly away from DOGE indicates Musk is likely feeling the blowback himself. Investors may have hoped that Musk’s role in the administration would see carveouts for Tesla in Trump’s trade war. But in fact, the electric vehicle brand is far from immune. Tesla manufactures its electric vehicles in the US, which makes it less exposed to 25 per cent automotive tariffs than foreign brands. But the tariffs are not just on finished cars; there is also a 25 per cent levy on all imported automotive parts, and Tesla relies on many parts imported from China, in addition to Mexico and Canada: the company is dependent on imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to fuel its EVs, in particular using Chinese manufacturer CATL to supply its factories. And China’s new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets have also impacted other projects from Tesla such as its Optimus humanoid robots. With Tesla dependent on batteries and rare earth products from China, the trade war will inevitably hit its supply chain. Following Tesla’s plummeting profits, it might have been expected that the share price could drop further - but the opposite has happened. On Tuesday, the share price had risen 4.6 per cent; following the announcement of Mr Musk’s intentions to resume greater oversight of corporate rather than Capitol Hill activities, that trajectory continued. Tesla shares are up more than seven per cent in pre-trading, set to open well above $250 per share - still a far cry from December’s peak. Lowered expectations can explain part of it, as well as a broader desire from investors to see a bull run resume - from lower share price starting points. “Tesla’s first-quarter delivery and production numbers were as ugly as its Cybertruck design. That meant expectations were rock-bottom in the run-up to its financial results and it’s why the shares didn’t tank upon release of the Q1 earnings,” noted Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. “Certain individuals are spotting an opportunity and might take the view that Tesla’s significant share price decline has gone too far - they’re buying on the dip, hoping for a bounce-back and might view the recent sell-off as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pick up shares in a previous stock market darling on the cheap. After all, the fundamentals still give bulls something to get excited about.” Not everyone is quite as excited about those humanoid robots, self-driving taxis and energy storage products though. “While Tesla is making progress on these initiatives, we believe the market and management commentary are overly optimistic about the timing. The narrative around Tesla’s stock and valuation remains heavily dependent on these future prospects,” Valechha cautioned. It should also be noted, the uptick isn’t totally down to Tesla, Musk or anything to do with electrification - Trump’s China tariff climbdown has sent the S&P 500 two per cent higher in pre-trading, with the likes of Amazon and Nvidia up four per cent each. Market volatility comes as standard in this second Trump term, and for Tesla which inadvertently became a crossover company to the political arena, that continues to go double.

Independent,Business,"Co-op prioritises corporate greed over animal welfare, says Chris Packham",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/coop-prioritises-corporate-greed-over-animal-welfare-says-chris-packham-b2752877.html,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice TV presenter Chris Packham has urged the Co-op to stop the sale of so-called “Frankenchickens” as he blamed the “greed of the corporate world” for prioritising profit over animal welfare. The broadcaster and naturalist joined demonstrators outside the supermarket’s AGM in Manchester. They are calling on the chain to ditch fast-growing chickens raised for meat, known as “Frankenchickens”, from its supply chain. “Frankenchickens” are bred to produce the maximum amount of meat in the shortest amount of time and can reach a slaughter weight of more than 2.0kg in five to six weeks, according to animal welfare charity The Humane League. Speaking to the PA news agency from the protest, Packham said the rapid growth rate of the chickens puts a “horrendous” burden on the “physiology and the anatomy” of the birds. “Basically, they’re taking on too much weight too quickly for their skeleton to cope with it, and we see all sorts of hideous deformities and muscular problems in the chickens, they end up scrabbling around in their own excrement, which is acrid and burns their skin off,” he said. Some supermarkets justify their use of “Frankenchickens” by arguing some customers cannot afford meat raised in better welfare conditions, the environmentalist added. “There’s an ethical problem there to start with and that is that people on lower incomes should have as much right to exercise their choices when it comes to the ethics of animal welfare as anyone else,” he said. “That is entirely wrong to say that people can’t afford to make an ethical choice – well, that affordability is in the hands of the Co-op. “They’re the ones that are setting the price and we know full well that supermarkets sell some of the items on their shelves at loss to lure us in, where they make a profit on other items.” Of the price difference between chickens raised in higher and lower welfare conditions, Packham continued: “The interesting thing is, I need to be very clear about this, the increase when it comes to chicken is in pence, not pounds. “It’s pence we’re talking about here, so this is basically the greed of the corporate world, once again, striving to maximise its profits at the expense of high welfare standards.” On his message for Co-op customers, Packham said: “The pound in our pockets or purses is incredibly powerful. “If we don’t buy it, they won’t sell it because they’re interested in making a profit.” A motion proposed at the Co-op AGM (annual general meeting) two years ago to stop the chain using “Frankenchickens” was passed by 96%, but since then “nothing has happened”, he added. Another motion on phasing out the use of the fast-growing chickens was passed at Saturday’s AGM with 90.94% voting in favour. According to the motion, the Co-op is supplied with more than 10 million chickens, 98% of which are “Frankenchickens”. A spokesperson for the Co-op said: “Animal welfare is extremely important to us and our members, and we work hard to ensure all the animals in our supply chain are looked after. “All Co-op fresh chicken is 100% British, reared in lower-stocking density environment and exceeds Red Tractor standards, placing us significantly ahead of most other retailers for chicken welfare. “We will explore all opportunities to continue to improve animal welfare across our supply chain, whilst also considering the impacts on British farming, on the environment and the prices our members and customers pay in store.” Claire Williams, campaigns manager at The Humane League UK, said: “If human babies grew as quickly as Frankenchickens they’d weigh as much as an adult tiger at two months old – that’s nearly 300 kilos. “These birds have been bred to suffer; their lives are marked by pain, stress and burden. Yet so-called ethical retailer Co-op continues to sell them. “This urgently needs to change.” Members at Saturday’s meeting also voted in favour of ceasing “all trading” with Israel following the conflict in Gaza. Citing the Co-op’s previous decision to “boycott Russian products” following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the motion read: “We urge the board to show moral courage and leadership, apply the same ethical principles and values it did to Russia, and take all Israeli products off the shelves.” The board said it will consider the thoughts of members expressed by the non-binding vote. The motion passed with 72.8% voting in favour. The supermarket chain is currently recovering after a major cyber attack caused significant disruption including bare shelves in many of its shops in recent weeks.",2025-05-18
Independent,Business,Tax avoidance is on the rise – and the rich are leading the way,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/tax-avoidance-rachel-reeves-wealthy-b2752364.html,"New figures show that tax worth billions of pounds a year is being dodged, writes Chris Blackhurst. And despite repeated promises by the chancellor, it is the wealthiest who appear to be getting away with it the most It has taken the government spending watchdog to highlight what has long been suspected, that ministerial claims to be cracking down on tax avoidance come nowhere near the mark. Listening to them, and not only Labour but Tory ministers in recent years, you could be forgiven for supposing that Britain is a state where shielding wealth from the HM Revenue and Customs’ prying eyes is confined to the past. This was Rachel Reeves in her party conference speech last September: “We will crack down on tax avoidance and tax evasion.” And again, in her spring statement, proclaiming the Treasury will tackle “fraud committed by the wealthy, fraud facilitated by those in large corporations, and by individuals and companies who make it possible for others to hide money offshore”. Here is the Conservatives’ Jeremy Hunt, when chancellor in 2023: “We are against all fraud and all tax evasion, and we will continue to work very hard to reduce the tax gap.” To be fair, you could take your pick of any chancellor or shadow chancellor during the last few decades and you will find a speech lambasting tax avoidance schemes accompanied by a ringing pledge to bring them to an end. In its report, the National Audit Office (NAO) warns that the tax gap, the difference between the amount the HMRC believes is due and how much is collected, has risen, which “raises the possibility that underlying levels of non-compliance among the wealthy population could be greater than thought”. This was evidenced by a fall in penalties imposed on the wealthy – defined as those earning more than £200,000 a year or with assets of more than £2m – from 2,153 notices totalling £16.2m in 2018-19 to 456 worth £5.8m in 2023-24. This was over a period when the number of rich individuals in the UK grew, from 700,000 in 2018-19 to 850,000 in 2023-24. This weekend’s Sunday Times Rich List showcases how the rich generally become ever richer and brings the issue into annual sharp relief. Reeves announced tax rises aimed at the wealthy in her first Budget, including reducing the advantages enjoyed by non-doms, increasing capital gains tax and imposing VAT on private school fees. She also moved against winter fuel allowances, changed the inheritance tax rules for farmers and increased employers’ national insurance. While this latter group are going ahead and their effects will be felt, it is clear from the NAO’s findings that the wealthy have ways to escape what was aimed at them. This does not include non-doms who are closely defined and the code that applies to them is simply applied. The reaction of many of the non-doms has been to leave the UK for other countries which are only too glad to welcome them and the money they invest and the jobs they create. In this regard, Reeves is extremely short-sighted. No, it is more about the consistent failure of politicians to clamp down closer to home. They always talk a good game but their performance in office is lamentable. Alas, the same cannot be said for Reeves’ quick hits of winter fuel and the rest – the less well-off are easily clobbered and have no way out. There will likely be a repeat in Reeves’ next budget, due in the autumn, as the softening-up exercise is well underway, with signals appearing suggesting extra money must be found to pay for public services and heightened defence commitments. Brace yourselves for further tax increases is the message as we head into the summer. As well as possessing the ways, the wealthy have the means. It does not take rocket science or even the spending of more than a few minutes to gauge the scale of the UK industry devoted to avoiding tax (evading is illegal and is therefore not so brazen). There are advisers galore, all willing to engage in what is euphemistically called “tax efficiency” for a fee. Those with the largest pots of cash can avail themselves of impenetrable trusts arranged for them in the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and further afield in the likes of Gibraltar, Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands. Bizarrely, given the “can do, will do” boasts about launching renewed tax drives against the UK wealthy, all the places where UK firms boast of maintaining offices and connections are ours; they are UK-protected. Nothing meaningful is ever done to curb this offshore trade. Along with tourism, it represents a lucrative source of income. Better it occurs, reasons the Foreign Office that oversees them, than they suffer and come cap in hand for London’s financial and welfare support. In her Budget, Reeves provided additional funding for HMRC that specifically included tackling offshore non-compliance. But in its report, the NAO urged ministers to redouble their efforts to secure more of the money owed to the Exchequer. Billions of pounds, concludes the watchdog, are going unpaid each year. Additional steps were required to make sure the wealthy paid their fair share. That did not deter a spokesperson for HMRC from still insisting in relation to the NAO report: “It’s our duty to ensure everyone pays the right tax under the law, regardless of wealth or status. The government is delivering the most ambitious ever package to close the tax gap and bring in an extra £7.5bn for public services per year by 2029-30.” So, we can look forward to the NAO scrutinising in the future and being satisfied, then?

Independent,Politics,The £25bn-a-year prize at stake in Starmer’s Brexit reset talks,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-uk-eu-reset-trade-deal-starmer-b2752285.html,"A failure to land a deal for easier trading with the EU could cost the UK economy almost £30bn, new analysis shows I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice A £25bn annual boost to British exports is at stake for Sir Keir Starmer as he tries to secure a Brexit reset deal at a crucial summit on Monday, analysis shared with The Independent reveals. Removing trade barriers on goods, including food and drink and electrical items, could result in a 2.2 per cent uplift in gross domestic product in the long run, boosting the economic growth the prime minister so desperately wants to deliver, financial analysts Frontier Economics found. And a separate assessment by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) warns that a failure to land a deal for easier trading could lead to a 2.7 per cent drop in exports by 2027, costing the UK economy almost £30bn. The impact on the British economy from such a deal is expected to dwarf that of the agreements recently signed with India and the US. On Saturday night, Sir Keir said it would be “good for our jobs, good for our bills and good for our borders”. Gordon Brown’s former economic adviser Lord Jim O’Neill summed up the importance of Sir Keir’s summit in London: “Obviously, the closer and more serious we can get, the better it is for reversing our net trade losses, and importantly, net investment from EU areas. “Given the shock from Trump [tariffs] to Europe, especially on Germany, on top of the Ukraine shock and China slowdown, I think Germany [will be] more open to pro-UK trade issues than before. “Also, I suspect the EU is going to give more than lip service to cross-border services sector reform now. Given UK net advantages in service sector exports, this is important to us.” Such reforms could make it easier for the UK to sell services to the bloc by allowing mutual recognition of qualifications so UK professionals can practice in the EU and vice versa without having a retrain. NIESR’s interim director Stephen Millard said the value of Monday’s deal should not be underestimated. He said: “In 2024 we exported roughly £6.5bn to India, roughly £53.5bn to the United States and roughly £159bn to the European Union. It is fairly clear from those numbers that a trade deal with the European Union is much more likely to shift the dial than the deals with India and the United States.” His assessment was echoed by Chris Southworth, director general of the UK’s largest business organisation, the International Chambers of Commerce, who noted that the trade deal signed with Donald Trump, which saw tariffs slashed on UK car and steel exports, was a “damage limitation agreement” and only accounted for 13 per cent of international gross domestic product (GDP). But he fears the deal to be unveiled on Monday “may not be ambitious enough” especially if it only focuses on goods rather than the future growth areas of digital services. It is a view shared by the Labour chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee Dame Emily Thornberry. In an interview with The Independent, she called on Sir Keir to be more “courageous”, adding: “We should be going further than the government currently seems to have the ambition for doing.” The deal is expected to include closer defence cooperation, goods and services, and a youth mobility agreement, which would allow 18- to 30-year-olds to live and work in the UK and Europe for a time-limited period. It has also been reported that it will include an agreement to allow EU trawlers to fish in British waters. Two immediate big wins could be to include the UK in the €150bn (£126bn) EU defence procurement fund, which would allow the government to bid for military equipment contracts and invite them to join the EU data hub. The latter is being championed by Poland, who currently have the presidency of the EU. A special report from earlier this year found that Brexit had cost the UK £30.2bn in settlement costs, stopped 16,400 businesses from exporting to the EU, and could lead to a 15 per cent long-term loss of trade. From the £24.8bn export boost for the UK estimated by Frontier Economics in a report commissioned by pro-EU group Best for Britain, farm food exports alone could see a £3.2bn increase. Agricultural exports have suffered since Brexit, with food and drink exports down by more than a third, according to trade bodies. The EU, meanwhile, would also benefit, with a £22.4bn boost to exports in goods and services from a closer agreement, selling £5bn more in agricultural products. Amar Breckenridge, senior associate at Frontier Economist, said that some of the economic damage caused by President Trump’s tariffs could be offset by the benefits of a closer EU trading relationship. While tariffs could still cost the UK £4.3bn in GDP under the new US trade deal, Mr Breckenridge estimates the UK could claw back £8.1bn from closer trading with the EU. The long-awaited youth mobility scheme alone could boost GDP by 0.45 per cent in the next decade, according to a separate study from the Centre for European Reform. But recent reports suggest that the deal might hit speed bumps in a row over high student fees for EU students coming to the UK, in addition to a lack of flexibility over the amount of fish EU countries can take from British waters. On youth mobility, John Springford, associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform, noted: “The youth mobility scheme would raise GDP by bringing more young EU workers into the UK labour force – although the final numbers will depend on how many are allowed to come and how long they can stay for.” Introducing it could amount to 31,000 more young people a year coming to the UK at the highest end, which would mean more people working and contributing to the economy. But EU officials want lower fees for their students, according to reports, which is causing tension ahead of Monday’s talks. International students currently pay around £12,000 more in fees on average per year than domestic students. The number of EU students at UK universities has dropped by nearly half since Brexit, with 75,000 EU nationals enrolled in British colleges and universities in the 2023/24 academic year – down from 148,000 in 2019. The Independent estimates that UK universities generate around £1bn a year in extra fees from EU students, which is likely why the government is facing domestic pushback over lowering fees. However, according to research from the London School of Economics, lowering fees would have a positive impact because EU students spend around £61,000 here over the course of their studies, on top of their tuition fees.

Independent,Politics,Talks over winter fuel U-turn ‘intensify’ as Labour bids to woo voters,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-reeves-winter-fuel-uturn-labour-b2752608.html,"Prime minister Keir Starmer under pressure as focus groups tell government they might not bear a grudge if there is a reversal of the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s cuts I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer is poised to reverse controversial reforms to his government’s infamous winter fuel payment cuts as soon as June, according to reports. The move could allow the party to repair its damaged relationship with voters and tackle the threat from Nigel Farage and Reform UK. Rachel Reeves’s decision to strip 10 million pensioners of the payment within weeks of taking office has proven toxic for her party and was a key issue during last month’s local elections, which were disastrous for Labour. Discussion on the policy within No 10 has intensified after focus groups of voters showed Labour could be forgiven for the move if there was a full or semi-U-turn, according to The i Paper. And, asked during a trip to Albania whether he was considering changing course, the PM refused to rule out making more people eligible for the allowance. Ministers are considering whether to give more pensioners the allowance, by increasing the £11,500 income cut threshold over which they no longer get the payment or by reversing it altogether, the paper reported. It comes as No 10 is also facing a potential Labour rebellion next month when changes to welfare are voted on in the House of Commons. More than 100 Labour MPs have signed a letter raising their concerns about the cuts. In the wake of the elections, which saw Reform win more than 500 council seats, Sir Keir publicly ruled out an outright U-turn, telling broadcasters, “we had to stop the chaos, we had to stabilise the economy”. But just hours before, the health secretary, Wes Streeting, failed to rule out a reversal of the policy. Senior Labour figures have also joined calls for ministers to restore the payment to at least some of those affected. A Treasury spokesperson pointed The i to Ms Reeves’s repeated denials that she will change course. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “We had to take tough but right decisions in the Budget to stabilise the economy after years of damage and decline. “As a result of what we’ve done, [we have] got record investment into the NHS, which is bringing down waiting lists and delivering three million extra appointments in the first 10 months of a Labour government, with four interest rate cuts and growth figures of 0.7 per cent. “The decisions we made weren’t easy. But it’s clear they are having the effect of stabilising our economy and allowing our economy to grow, putting more money in the pockets of working people.” Ministers insist they had to cut the allowance to repair the public finances following a £22bn “black hole” left by the previous government. The policy is expected to save the government around £1.5bn a year, but will push more than 100,000 pensioners into poverty. The change is more widely known than any of Labour’s other policies, while around two-thirds of voters dislike it. Luke Tryl, executive director of polling organisation More In Common, has described it as Labour’s “original sin” and said it had a major impact on the party’s disastrous performance in this month’s elections.

Independent,Politics,Hundreds of MPs and peers call for Starmer to ban Iranian army,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-iran-revolutionary-corps-tehran-b2752882.html,"Three Iranian men in London were charged with spying offences after a counter terror probe I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer is facing calls from hundreds of MPs and peers to ban Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) amid a deteriorating human rights picture in the UK and after three Iranian men were charged with spying in London. Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock is among those urging the prime minister to outlaw the IRGC, warning “the human rights crisis in Iran continues to worsen”. It came as three Iranian men living in London were charged under the National Security Act, accused of engaging in conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service. More than 550 MPs and peers, also including former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and ex-home secretary Suella Braverman, signed a letter criticising Iran’s “hijab and chastity law”. They said it “mandatory hijab, suppressing women who lead the protest and resistance movement to prevent future uprisings”. “Appeasing this faltering regime betrays democratic values, emboldens its repressive policies, and undermines global security as Tehran continues its nuclear ambitions and terrorism,” the letter said. It added: “Given the regime’s complete blockade of all avenues for political activity, the international community must recognise the Iranian people’s right to regime change. “The IRGC should be designated as a terrorist organisation,” the letter said. The UK has previously resisted calls to ban the IRGC over fears it could sever the country’s diplomatic link with Tehran. But Tory MP Bob Blackman, chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee, said “it’s time to change course on our Iran policy”. Mr Blackman, who coordinated the letter, said: “Our ally, the US, rightly designated the IRGC as a terrorist entity several years ago. While the regime has never been weaker, we must set aside all wrong-headed political and diplomatic calculations and proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist entity — an action long overdue.” Following the recent arrests and charging of the Iranian men, Mr Blackman said: ““Iranian terrorism has reached our soil. A serious terror plot, involving several Iranians, was recently thwarted in the UK.” The letter came as Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori were charged with engaging in conduct likely to assist the Iranian foreign intelligence service between last August and February. Sepahvand was also charged with engaging in surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research, intending to commit serious violence against a person in the UK. Manesh and Noori have also been charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance, with the intention that serious violence against a person in the UK would be committed by others. Former Tory MP and minister David Jones said there is a “growing consensus among UK politicians that the time for a new policy on Iran has arrived”. The MPs backed Iranian opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran’s 10-point plan to “end the religious dictatorship and transfer sovereignty to the people’s representatives”. The group calls for an end to compulsory hijab and religion, an end to dictatorship and executions and a democratic Iranian state. The Foreign Office was asked to comment. Following the charges brought against the three Iranian men, Yvette Cooper promised to strengthen national security powers. The home secretary said: ""I want to thank the police and security services for their continuing work on this very serious investigation, and for their immense dedication to protecting our national security and the safety of our communities. ""The charges that have been laid against these three individuals must now take their course through the criminal justice system and nothing must be done to prejudice the outcome of those proceedings. ""But we will also take separate action to address the very serious wider issues raised by this case. ""The police have confirmed that the foreign state to which these charges relate is Iran, and Iran must be held to account for its actions. ""We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-18
Independent,Politics,Starmer accused of ignoring foreign press at post-Brexit reset summit,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-brexit-uk-eu-summit-b2752848.html,"A foreign journalist said news wires from Spain, Italy and Germany have been denied access to the EU-UK summit on Monday I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer has been accused of shutting European news outlets out of his much-hyped EU-UK summit on Monday. With the prime minister set to unveil his post-Brexit reset plans alongside Brussels leaders, the Foreign Press Association (FPA) has said “almost every European news outlet” with a foreign correspondent in London has been denied access to the summit. In a letter sent to Downing Street the FPA, which represents foreign journalists based in the UK, said: “Sir Keir Starmer, you state that you want a reset with the EU. You organise a summit between the UK and the EU to restart the relationship. “Yet you deny accreditation to almost every European news outlet who has a foreign correspondent in London, leaving out the biggest news agencies, the most important papers, the most trusted broadcasters. “The Foreign Press Association in London represents the top international news outlets in the world, the vast majority of which have been denied access to Monday’s summit. “We urge you to reconsider, if not out of a consideration for press freedom at least out of fairness.” One journalist hoping to attend the summit said two of their countries biggest news outlets had been shut out, comparing it to shutting the BBC and PA out of a summit in Brussels. The reporter said: “I believe it is a complete and utter shambles. They have denied access to public broadcasters and news wires from Spain, Italy, Germany and many other countries but granted it to freelancers. “Either they have no understanding of who the key players in European media are, or they simply don’t care.” Government officials said they had received 500 accreditation requests for only 100 spaces, with the majority of those 100 awarded to European outlets. “We always accommodate as much as we can,” a source stressed. Monday’s summit is the culmination of months of negotiations between the UK and EU on the future of Britain’s relationship with Brussels. The prime minister will be joined by European Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa as they set out a path forward. Major announcements include the expected unveiling of a youth mobility scheme between the UK and EU, which would let young people live, work and study freely between Britain and Europe. Britain is also hoping to secure access to the EU’s major 150 billion euro defence fund, which would be a significant boost to the UK’s arms firms.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Simon Armitage: ‘It’s not my job to bring the nation together’,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/simon-armitage-interview-poet-laureate-hay-morrissey-b2750393.html,"The esteemed writer speaks with Claire Allfree about the misconceptions of his royal role, why all nature poetry is now innately conservationist – and that infamous and ‘scary’ Morrissey interview I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The second poem in Simon Armitage’s new poetry collection is titled “Drey” – a reference to the small hanging baskets of branches in which squirrels live. Armitage describes a drey as a “twig and leaf crow’s nest squat/ wombed with feathers and moss”. I hadn’t heard of the word before, I tell him. “It often comes up in crossword clues,” the poet laureate replies, in his unusually slow, deliberate voice. “Although if you spell it with an ‘a’, it has something to do with beer barrels: ‘A brewer’s dray.’ There’s a richness there. But I was really thinking about animal habitats, and I realised each animal home has a specific word. Almost like an address.” That conceit is at the heart of Dwell – a playful, magical set of poems, each one devoted to a different habitat in the British landscape. There’s the usual – “Pond”, “Sett”, “Lodge” and “Web “(or “trampolines of death” as the 61-year-old puts it) – but also lesser-known abodes like “Scrape”, the home of a hare, and “Hibernaculum”, the underground shelters used by hibernating animals. Armitage imagines a hedgehog curled up like “spiky boxing gloves”. The poems are like miniature stories, combining his conversational style and startling lyrical precision with that sly narrative wit: “Deer Diary”, for instance, is an elegantly structured tease that plays on that animal’s elusive character and sense of mystery. The poems were commissioned by the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall, where they will eventually become inscribed into the earth and foliage, in the form of installations, recordings and sculptures, “like an alternative guided tour”, as Armitage puts it. (He’ll also be reading from them later this month at the Hay Festival.) “The Gardens [which date from the 18th century and have since become Europe’s largest restoration project] are very manicured, very exotic, almost tropical,” he says. “But the animals you find there are very British. And that’s fortunate because we are losing species hand over fist. Despite the Gardens being almost foreign, they have become a refuge.” Environmentalism has been at the heart of Armitage’s wide-roving nature poetry for years. It’s unavoidable. Yet he dislikes the idea that his poems might be seen as a form of campaigning. When I tell him Dwell put me in mind of Robert Macfarlane’s The Lost Words project, which set out to reclaim common nature words that are falling out of use among children, Armitage replies sniffily: “I didn’t want to tell children what words they should use and what they shouldn’t. I didn’t want to be didactic.” Certainly, Dwell is often very funny: “Insect Hotel” consists of snippy Airbnb-style reviews from its various diverse residents. “Horrendous. Brought the kids with us but next morning they’d been eaten by a Dunnock. Two thumbs down.” Armitage argues that the great pastoral tradition that has sustained English poetry for centuries has lost its innocence. Or rather, its complacency. “Poetry has definitely got its money’s worth out of nature,” he says. “Nature has been both backdrop and sentiment, and there has been the sense that it would be there for ever, always available to be exploited for all these artistic purposes. But that world doesn’t exist any more. Whenever you write about nature these days you are involved in conservation.” Even the wild, magnificent poetry of his beloved Ted Hughes was concerned with this, Armitage says. “Hughes wanted to capture the wonder of nature. Wonder can be ecstatic, and it can also be terrifying. In recreating that, he made us want to taste more of it, and to live in a world where that could exist.” Armitage is talking to me over Zoom from his attic garret in his house in Yorkshire, where he lives with his second wife, the BBC radio producer Sue Roberts, a few miles from the village of Marsden where he grew up (the couple have a daughter, Emmeline, a national slam poet champion in her twenties). I can’t give any more details because he has blurred out the backdrop on his screen, meaning only his face is visible. “I hadn’t tidied up,” he says a bit sheepishly, although it later transpires that he is oddly oblivious to his surroundings anyway. “I’m always being told I don’t notice things, particularly in the garden.” Surely this is rather strange for a poet? “Oh, I’m a very poor looker. But I think I dwell on things instead. I’d rather encourage people to think rather than see.” He’s been encouraging readers gently, wryly, sometimes emphatically and often beautifully throughout a career stretching more than 30 years. Armitage became poet laureate in 2019 – it’s a 10-year post, which he is just over halfway through. More than any living exemplar I know, he defies the popular image of a poet as a wan aesthete producing impenetrable verse from a lofty ivory tower. There is something hewn from the earth about him, something tangy and stubborn, solid and rooted. He talks this way too, choosing his words carefully and thoughtfully, his voice plain and flat. He can also be the teensiest bit chippy. In his time as poet laureate, for which he is paid in sherry (a staggering 720 bottles a year), he has more than stepped up to the plate as the nation’s poetic avatar, responding not just to the big national events such as royal deaths and coronations, but to smaller, less obvious moments, too. He has just completed a set of poems that have been inscribed, in ship’s brass, into the new shore defences in Portsmouth. This has tickled him since he studied geography at Portsmouth Poly but spent his time writing poems instead. “And now I’ve got the chance to put a bit of poetry into the geography,” he says, delighted in a very dry, Simon Armitage kind of way. Yet he is not at all keen on questions about being poet laureate. “The nub of being poet laureate seems to be being asked what the point is of being poet laureate,” he says. “It’s almost a full-time job. And royalty is like catnip for journalists. So, I’m slightly unwilling to talk about all that.” I suspect this reluctance is at least partly because he intuits that some might regard a working-class poet from Yorkshire (if I were to guess his politics, I’d swing left) as being slightly incongruent with a job that has clear establishment connotations. He avoids political messaging in his poetry, which encompasses the tenderest of love poems and the GSCE staples “Poundland” and “Hitcher”, but his plays tend to have sharper teeth. Both his 2015 dramatisation of The Odyssey and his version of Hansel and Gretel for Shakespeare’s Globe were deeply concerned with the contemporary refugee crisis. Being poet laureate is about writing the best poems I can When I ask whether today’s sharply polarised cultural landscape makes his job of being poet laureate particularly challenging, he shuts down. “I don’t see it as my job to bring the nation together,” he says. And: “I refer you to my previous answer. I see it as being about writing the best poems I can.” Fair enough. He’s certainly a terrific ambassador for the form – a trustee of the National Poetry Centre, which plans to open a national home for poetry in Leeds in 2027; a former poetry professor at Oxford and Sheffield; a current professor of poetry at Leeds; and a regular presence on TV and radio. Alongside several plays, he has produced acclaimed translations of Homeric verse and the medieval epic Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and has published more than 20 original collections. He is also the lead singer of LYR (Land Yacht Register), which released its debut album in 2022. A year later, he published a book of song lyrics, Never Good with Horses. He is a music nut. Incidentally, he is also known for an infamous interview he conducted with his hero Morrissey for The Guardian in 2010. During that sit-down, Morrissey made an ugly racist comment about Chinese people, which made headline news at the time. Armitage has often refused to talk about that conversation and its fallout – but now, he says: “It was quite a scary period of my life. Morrissey was a powerful and, I assume, wealthy individual and I’d reported what had happened in good faith in a way that allowed people to make up their own minds about it. And it had blown up way beyond the interview. Lawyers were all over it. It became very uncomfortable.” Did Morrissey’s comment affect how Armitage felt about his music? “I don’t think it did. I think I had recognised Morrissey as someone who could drop bombs. I still listen to the Smiths. I don’t judge people by fractions and portions of what they have said. If Joseph Lister had turned out to be an absolute bastard, I’d still be taking antibiotics.” Later, perhaps feeling he hasn’t answered sufficiently, he emails me to elaborate more broadly on the issue of cancel culture. “It troubles me when people are vilified for making mistakes, or worse, if they’ve been trying to do the right thing but have used the wrong language or made an error of judgement [Morrissey, who is an animal rights advocate, made his comments in the context of China’s deplorable record on animal welfare]. There are enough truly terrible people in the world without having to aim hatred at those who’ve innocently or accidentally or inadvertently strayed from the course of righteousness. “And I don’t think we should strip away the cultural furniture of our past, no matter how unworthy it now seems. Just put a different sign on it and give it a new context, a reminder of how and why we’ve changed, and from what. We need to know what we were like.” Lawyers were all over the Morrissey interview. It became very uncomfortable Armitage never intended to become a professional poet. Instead, after earning an MA in social work in 1988, he followed his father into the probation service in Manchester. He left in 1994, overwhelmed by some of the horrors he had witnessed, and devoted himself full time to poetry, having already published his first collection, Zoom!, five years earlier. For some time, Armitage regarded his new career as a clean break from what he had been doing before. Now he thinks the two things are inextricably related. “At the time I absolutely rejected the idea that I’d become some sort of social worker in verse, because when I left the service I wanted to escape its orbit. But I can see now I’ve carried on working with some of the same sensibilities and sympathies,” he says. “I’ve written a lot for marginalised people, people who’ve had their voices taken away, who are damaged or broken. And I have found some pleasure in realising writing poetry wasn’t just escapism.” Armitage agrees that, perhaps more than any other genre, poetry gives voice to the dispossessed. “That’s why it is such a humane activity, because it recognises the individual viewpoint instead of mass ones.” What, though, does he feel about its future? AI, decreased attention spans, declining literacy rates: surely all pose an existential threat to one of the oldest art forms in the world? “One of the joys of translating medieval poetry is that it’s often anonymous [the Sir Gawain manuscript, for example, is by an unknown author]. We don’t know who wrote these pieces but it’s an incredible thrill to know they came from the soul of a human being who lived 800 years ago. AI, if it becomes good enough, will deny us that. It’s intriguing, but it’s also devastating.” He despairs at how mobile phones are destroying the way we daydream. “People ask me where poems come from and I talk about the importance of letting your mind drift into a contemplative state, where you might collect a bit of language, a bit of a story, and from a poetry point of view, that can be the beginning of a piece of work,” he says. “But we deny ourselves that now because every time there is a lull, we get out the device and it tells us what to think. That’s very worrying for poetry because it’s the art form of concentration.” I suggest to Armitage that we no longer know how to be bored. “Yes, and that’s a real shame, because I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s when there was absolutely nothing to do, and it led me and my mates into doing some extraordinary things.” He thinks In Praise of Boredom would make a good title for a book. “I’d certainly buy a book called that.” ‘Dwell’ (Faber & Faber) is out now.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,All eight Mission: Impossible movies – ranked from worst to best,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/mission-impossible-ranked-movies-b2751802.html,"As the perpetually building-climbing Ethan Hunt faces ‘The Final Reckoning’, Adam White and Louis Chilton rank all eight of the Mission movies (so far?) – from the one with Philip Seymour Hoffman to the one with all the slow-motion doves I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Our mission, should we choose to accept it? Ranking every film in the Mission: Impossible franchise. In the years since the classic 1966 espionage TV show was rebooted by Brian De Palma in 1996, Tom Cruise’s action franchise has gone on to become a modern Hollywood stalwart. While the films took a while to really find their footing, Mission: Impossible has also been one of the most reliably enjoyable franchises out there, with every entry having something to recommend it: balletic fight choreography; audacious, death-defying stunts; Shea Whigham. As such, ranking the films largely comes down to personal taste. (Though you can probably guess which entry takes the lowest spot. That’s right: that one.) The latest film in the franchise, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, is out in cinemas next week, and serves as a direct follow-up to 2021’s Dead Reckoning (originally titled Dead Reckoning – Part One). Described by The Independent’s critic Clarisse Loughrey as “an inherently absurd” film that “also reaches such highs that it’s hard to really be that bothered”, The Final Reckoning looks poised to be one of the franchise’s most divisive films to date. Here is The Independent’s ranking of every Mission: Impossible film, from the 1996 original to Final Reckoning… Putting John Woo’s uber-glossy sequel in bottom place here is a little like declaring The Godfather Part III the worst of that trilogy: well, obviously. But while M:I-II struggles with self-seriousness and is a little too in love with its innumerable latex-mask plot twists, it’s still often incredibly fun. You’ve got Cruise with long hair, Thandiwe Newton giving a Mission: Impossible version of Catwoman as a slinky thief, and Metallica and Limp Bizkit providing the music cues, for goodness sake. Do you remember a single thing about Dougray Scott’s elaborate scheme to steal a lethal virus? Probably not. But you will likely recall how this film possesses arguably the greatest bit of terrible-amazing dialogue in the history of cinema: “This isn’t Mission: Difficult, Mister Hunt,” intones mysterious spy poppa Sir Anthony Hopkins, “it’s Mission: Impossible”. Huzzah! The latest – maybe last – instalment in the series annoyingly reflects the best and worst instincts of these things. There is a brilliant lightness of touch to the action here, notably a scene in which Ethan dangles perilously off the wing of a prop plane, but there’s also a stodginess and an almost Marvel-coded devotion to legacy and callbacks that weighs it down. The Final Reckoning is also long, clocking in at a grand 170 minutes, with at least 60 of those not especially earned. Perhaps it’s a villain problem – Esai Morales’s anonymous Gabriel and the all-seeing artificial intelligence known as The Entity, both introduced in 2023’s Dead Reckoning, remain far too silly to work. Or it’s the fact that this film has reportedly been filmed, edited and endlessly tweaked for close to three years. Either way it feels too worked-on, as if no one could particularly figure out what the finished product should be. This is, of course, still largely entertaining. But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if it marked the end of the road. JJ Abrams made his feature directorial debut here after David Fincher dropped out (imagine!), and it can’t help but play like an extended episode of his TV series Alias as a result. That long-running spy drama cast Jennifer Garner as a secret agent attempting to preserve some semblance of a private life – and Ethan more or less goes through the same predicament here, as we meet him in the midst of marital bliss with Michelle Monaghan’s lovely Julia, who is ignorant of her husband’s espionage escapades. Overall, the pacing is a little off and the set pieces aren’t particularly novel – Cruise took a salary cut as Paramount were nervous about spending big on this one – but it has one major ace up its sleeve: Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a slippery arms dealer, is unsurprisingly brilliant here, and comfortably remains the franchise’s greatest villain. There is such shiny ease to Christopher McQuarrie’s handling of these characters and the form of these movies that Dead Reckoning is by and large a total pleasure. The set pieces remain breathtaking (a Venice car chase featuring Ethan and Hayley Atwell’s ebullient pick-pocket Grace in a tiny vehicle is the highlight) and there is a knowing silliness to the increasing absurdity on display: Vanessa Kirby playing Hayley Atwell playing Vanessa Kirby is exactly the kind of nonsense these films have perfected of late. But the attempts to grant Ethan a tragic backstory never really come off – Mission: Impossible hasn’t historically needed this type of thing, so why start now? – while the demise of Rebecca Ferguson’s marvellous Ilsa Faust shamefully unravels all the rewarding time spent in the two previous movies not making her just another one-shot female character in this franchise. In light of The Final Reckoning, it may be Mission: Impossible’s proper jump-the-shark moment. The wince-inducing sequence in which Ethan climbs Dubai’s Burj Khalifa skyscraper still holds the title for most impressive stunt in these films, which makes it slightly curious that director Brad Bird wasn’t invited back. Still, he did an impressive job of kicking the franchise into a new era. There is a noticeable split down the middle in Mission: Impossible just as Christopher McQuarrie (unbilled here but responsible for reworking the script mid-shoot) enters the picture. The films are suddenly funnier, more graceful in their ambitious stunt-work, and more rooted in ensemble-cast teamwork. But there are also growing pains: Jeremy Renner’s short-lived, possible Ethan replacement is deeply bland, while Michael Nyqvist’s nuclear strategist ended up the blueprint for this franchise’s increasingly rote villains. It practically goes without saying that MI6 agent Ilsa (“Rebecca Ferguson best of the yellow satin dress” has been viewed more than 26,000 times on YouTube, I should add) is an incredible shot in the arm for these movies just as they began to risk overkill. She’s the first Mission: Impossible supporting character – and certainly first female character – who feels as if they are Ethan’s conceptual equal: heroic, complicated, slightly maddening in their derring-do. Beyond Ilsa, though, Rogue Nation is a smooth operation, heavy on spectacle (that cargo plane opening sequence!) and moving at a brisk clip, as Ethan and his team take on The Syndicate, aka secret agents who’ve gone bad. It’s quite remarkable how little Brian De Palma’s first film resembles what the franchise would ultimately become – and how quickly his brand of chilly, paranoid menace was excised. It makes it slightly difficult to rank, and I wouldn’t necessarily blame anyone who finds it a tad dull. But it’s incredibly distinct as these movies go, tense and occasionally macabre, with flashes of stylish violence. It sees Ethan accused of murdering his team (among them Kristin Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez), before attempting to identify a traitor within the ranks of the Impossible Missions Force. There is such visceral thrill to the set pieces here – the massacre of Ethan’s comrades, the fish tank and the exploding bubble gum, that iconic dangle on the wires – that it’s difficult to ever dislike it. And the erotic charge to Ethan’s tangle with Vanessa Redgrave’s elegant arms dealer makes you miss when these films weren’t quite so chaste. The actual storytelling in Fallout is largely nonsensical. It’s something about suitcases of plutonium, and features far too many monologues that frame Ethan Hunt – and by extension, Tom Cruise – as the closest thing to Jesus Christ for the agents of the IMF. But holy smokes is Fallout just sensational as an action film. The Paris motorcycle chase. The speed-run along the South Bank. That cliff-edge helicopter closer. It’s all just so, so relentlessly fun. You also wonder, in light of the Reckoning two-parter, whether this would have worked better as a finale than a sixth film in an eight-movie franchise: story arcs come to a close, Henry Cavill – as a moustachioed hired gun – reloads his fists like they’re pistols, and Cruise snaps his ankle on camera.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Netflix’s Forever radically reimagines Judy Blume – but for the better,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/forever-netflix-judy-blume-cast-book-b2752408.html,"Blume’s willingness to treat teen fiction with the utmost candour has always ruffled feathers, writes Micha Frazer-Carroll. Netflix’s provocative new adaptation gets at the core of what makes the author such a unique and vital figure Recently, in a bout of morbid curiosity, I rescued from my parents’ house the stack of diaries that I had religiously kept throughout my teenage years. I was surprised by what I found – the near-daily entries didn't read like the juvenile and mundane scrawlings of the strait-laced secondary school student I remembered. Younger me wrote lucidly about her sexuality; her shortcomings; the complexities of her friendships. She described not only her feelings, but her feelings about her feelings. She did this with more candour than I think I am often capable of as an adult: there was something unabashed and rich about the life I had been living inside of my head. When adults underestimate children, I think we are often engaging in this kind of flawed self-referencing – not simply minimising “young people” as an abstract group, but revising, patronising and selling short our younger selves. Judy Blume, whose 1975 book Forever has this month been adapted into a Netflix series, was never one to do this. The American author has sold over 82 million copies of her books since the late 1960s, and is credited with having shaped the contemporary young adult genre; she has said that she remembers her childhood vividly. This much is obvious – you only need look at the way that her stories have managed to connect with young people across generations. In Judy Blume Forever, a 2023 Prime Video documentary about the author’s life and career, scores of children in archival footage of book signings marvel at her ability to articulate their thoughts and feelings. One girl says that Blume understands her better than her parents. To many, though, Blume’s realness was threatening. The housewife-turned-author’s books were full of discussions of masturbation and breasts and period blood and handjobs, peppered among the day-to-day teenage stuff. Forever, which candidly charted an emerging romantic and sexual relationship between high school seniors Katherine and Michael, was perhaps the most controversial of all. One mother told The New York Times in 1978: “I’d rather have my daughter read pornography than Forever.” While the sexual content meant critics and even Blume’s own publisher dubbed it a book for grown-ups, it seemed that adults were the ones most scandalised by it – with Forever being banned intermittently in the US until as recently as 2024. But the continued censorship of Blume’s work just goes to show how political her stories have always been, despite being ostensibly written for kids. And while adapting her work remains a daunting proposition (for all the factors listed above), Forever proves that Blume remains both universal and timeless. The Netflix TV show, created by Mara Brock Akil, captures perfectly the spirit of Blume’s writing, with a few twists. Katherine and Michael become Black Gen-Zer Keisha (Lovie Simone) and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), old classmates who cross paths at a house party full of mostly white teens. Tonally, the show starts out feeling relatively twee – an innocent portrayal of young love, sprinkled with trips to the mall and the movies. Then, all of a sudden, there’s sex. I don’t mean euphemistic, offscreen or sanitisingly alluded-to sex, but an incorporation of sex that feels just as surprising and jarring as when I stumbled across it in my own teenage diaries. I didn’t necessarily find its appearance jarring because it was young people doing it, but rather, I didn’t expect these seemingly sweet and innocent young people to be doing it, in this particular show. It was as if a plotline from Euphoria had wandered its way onto the set of Heartstopper. While there are parallels to the book, Akil also makes obvious departures. The Blackness of the show isn’t confined to its casting – it’s threaded throughout the script. Keisha wears a headscarf to bed and shares her dreams of going to the historically Black Howard University, while Justin’s mum aspires for her son to settle down with a Black girl. It’s also firmly situated in the 21st century, with a large chunk of the romantic tension emerging through text messages, and thorny present-day realities of teenage sex – like revenge porn – taking a front seat. These creative choices might take some adjusting to for loyal Blume fans, some of which are entering their fifties and sixties. But these choices also carry forward the political spirit of Blume’s work, which often goes unnamed. While Blume’s characters don’t usually talk politics explicitly, the sexual content in many of the author’s books mirrored the broader societal rebellion of the Sixties and Seventies. Gabrielle Moss, author of Paperback Crush: The Totally Radical History of '80s and '90s Teen Fiction, tells me: “Books like Forever reflected the massive changes that women were experiencing in US culture at the time, in a way that pretty much no one else writing for young people did. In short, Blume brought the feminist and sexual revolutions to teens.” It was, and still is, notable, that Forever is about a “nice girl” who has sex – written on the request of Blume’s then teen daughter Randy, who bemoaned tragedy narratives in which rebellious girls have sex, get pregnant and are either sent away or die via self-managed abortions. Moss tells me that, in this context, Forever was one of the only resources to learn about sex in a healthy way. “Sex education class at school wouldn't teach you about the pleasures of sex, just the dangers. Forever floated the idea that a teen's first sexual experiences could honestly be pretty wholesome – a simple, pleasant part of their growth into an adult. I think that's still a pretty radical idea.” Akil’s unapologetic adaptation of the story, about a “nice Black couple” falling in love, also brings the daily realities of a different social movement to its audience. Episode one opens with an argument between Justin, who is an aspiring basketball player, and his mother, who doesn’t think it’s safe for a young Black boy to go out to a party late at night: “We got cops out here shooting Black boys like it’s open season – and I’m trippin’?” While some might dub these themes “mature” for younger viewers, their inclusion shows an awareness of what young people are exposed to in the real world, just as Blume’s books did. Amid the politics, Akil’s depiction of a young, wholesome Black love also feels quietly radical. Blume didn’t initially license Forever for adaptation, fearing it wouldn’t translate to today. But the series’ eight episodes boldly step up to the task of adapting such a beloved, canonical author. Director Kelly Fremon Craig, who adapted Blume’s groundbreaking Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret as a film in 2023, told Variety: “You can feel like with every change you make, someone is going to be like, ‘Why would you change that?’ Like painting over a Picasso.” Akil’s Forever doesn’t shy away from that, and simply grabs a new canvas. It seems that the strength of Blume’s work lies not in its universality, but its ability to actually describe the specifics of young life to children, to take that responsibility seriously, and to tell the truth. ‘Forever’ is streaming now on Netflix Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-18
Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,How Twenty One Pilots became the streaming era’s biggest band,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-anniversary-b2749674.html,"Blending genres and tackling themes of mental health, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun surged to global fame and chart-topping success. On the 10th anniversary of ‘Blurryface,’ Ali Shutler talks to the band about their memories of that crucial time in their lives I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Twenty One Pilots are the biggest alternative band to come out of the streaming era by any metric. As you’d expect, their songs are a fluid blend of clashing genres that want to turn uneasy fears into cause for celebration. While you might not recognise the band name, you’ll definitely know the tracks: a couple of them have been streamed more than 2 billion times on Spotify. This week, their unlikely breakthrough album Blurryface turns 10. Taking inspiration from a lifetime of musical touchpoints, the band toyed with rock, reggae and indie-pop across Blurryface. It was messy and jarring, there was a lot of ukulele, but the whole thing was delivered with so much conviction; it worked. “We did want to make something that felt new,” admits vocalist Tyler Joseph. “But we weren’t looking over the top of our small fan base, trying to reach this broad audience. That just happened.” And it happened hard. Released on 17 May 2015, Twenty One Pilots’ fourth album was the first crossover album post-Spotify, and perhaps the last proper breakout rock record. It instantly hit No 1 in America and reached No 14 in the UK, but went on to spend 120 weeks in the Top 100. “We didn’t even know what getting a ‘No 1’ meant,” Joseph admits with a grin. He, just like bandmate, drummer Josh Dun, is guarded in interviews, sincere in song and not afraid to be a little silly onstage. Nothing much changed for the two-piece at first as they set off on their already-announced Blurryface world tour, but things began to snowball. In November, they played a sold-out headline show at London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire to 2,000 fans. The following February, it was Brixton. In November 2016, it was a trio of gigs at Alexandra Palace with more than 30,000 in attendance. “That’s when we realised something was happening,” says Dun. Away from the road, Blurryface was racking up numbers on streaming as well. The chirpy funk of “Ride” soundtracked the summer before the wistful, nostalgic slow-burn of “Stressed Out” took over the radio, won them a Grammy and remains one of the most played songs on Spotify. With well over 2.6 billion plays, it’s above rock party staples such as The Killers’ “Mr Brightside”, Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and Oasis’ “Wonderwall”. Two years after it was first released, Blurryface became the first record in history to have every track certified gold in America, with the synth-driven “Hometown” the final song to crack 500,000 sales. There was such hunger for more that their previous record Vessel achieved the same lofty milestone. Just last month, “Doubt” went viral on TikTok. “It’s only looking back now that we fully realise just how much of a beast that album was,” Joseph says backstage at Madrid’s Movistar Arena ahead of another sold-out show. An early version of Twenty One Pilots formed in 2009 while Joseph was studying at Ohio State University, but things really came into focus when he teamed up with Dun in 2011. The pair built a loyal following through scrappy but ambitious local shows and were eventually signed to Noughties pop-punk powerhouse label Fueled By Ramen (Paramore, Fall Out Boy, Panic! At the Disco) for third album Vessel. It was a moderately successful record, tapping into the same soaring electro pop that had made superstars of Hozier and Cage the Elephant, while their DIY two-man show already featured costume changes and backflips. But unconventional song structures and spoken-word, metaphor-heavy lyrics about depression meant the band felt like a cult concern ­of the near future – especially in 2015. Digital downloads may have given kids the ability to listen to all sorts of music, but streaming made it compulsory – and the industry didn’t know how to react. After dominating youth culture throughout the Nineties and 2000s, rock music was in decline (in 2017, hip-hop would officially usurp it as the most popular genre), and bands were fighting to stay relevant. Established acts turned to radio-friendly pop while a new generation were adding half-hearted EDM sections to their snotty pop-punk anthems and claiming they’d always loved hip-hop. Rather than chasing rapidly changing trends, Twenty One Pilots wrote on the road while touring Vessel and wanted Blurryface to be full of songs that would help them create the perfect setlist for their live show. That’s still the driving force today, says Dun. “We knew we had an audience that trusted us and that was very freeing,” adds Joseph. “It felt like we could go in any direction we wanted.” Enjoy unlimited access to 100 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial.

Radio hits definitely weren’t what they were aiming for, though. “I remember finishing ‘Stressed Out’ and just thinking ‘Cool, another song done. We’re that much closer to having this record finished,’” says Dun. Their producer even advised them against including the now iconic pre-chorus “My name’s Blurryface and I care what you think” that anyone under 30 has definitely sung along to at least once. Ten years ago, not a lot of people were really talking about mental health, how they were doing, or what was going on inside their heads. “I had to explain to him that it was going to make sense to the fans,” says Joseph. “That it was a character with a backstory, as well as the name of the album. He trusted us, but I could see it on his face: ‘This song isn’t going to be a hit.’” “[We had] such ignorance and confidence at the same time,” adds Dun. The band used the album to introduce the world to Blurryface, a mysterious character that allowed the pair to confront their own anxieties. For live shows, Joseph would use black makeup to paint his throat and hands to represent the hold those fears had over him. “I feel more uncomfortable listening to the album now than when it was released,” he admits, not realising quite how revealing some of those songs were. “Still, writing about mental health on a major label record release was cake compared with trying to explain to our dads what we wanted to do with our lives.” “Ten years ago, not a lot of people were really talking about mental health, how they were doing, or what was going on inside their heads. But speaking to fans after shows, those conversations were very normal for us,” Dun adds. Like Green Day’s American Idiot and My Chemical Romance’s The Black Parade before it, the story of Blurryface connected with a generation of kids who were struggling; typical teenage growing pains amplified by the rise of social media. “It felt like there were all these rules about making music back then. I know I spent a few years before I got into Twenty One Pilots refusing to listen to anything that wasn’t pure guitar music,” says London-based artist Noahfinnce, 25, who now makes chaotic punk music but was inspired by the band to throw in the occasional electronic breakdown. “Twenty One Pilots were in that pop-punk, emo scene, but they didn’t sound like any other band around. It takes balls to not give a s*** about fitting in.” He believes the record connected with so many people because of how open the lyrics were about mental health, but also because of the strong visual world the band built around Blurryface. Online music fandom was at its peak thanks to sites like Tumblr and how accessible the internet had become, before Twitter turned those virtual communities into unmoderated shouting competitions. “Nowadays, everybody is in a fandom because everyone is online,” Noahfinnce explains. “Back then, it was this die-hard community that really gave you a sense of belonging.” In interviews, Twenty One Pilots acted like putting out a hugely influential album was all part of the master plan. They took their trousers off before walking onstage to collect their first Grammy, fulfilling a promise they made to each other years earlier while watching the ceremony at home in their pants when nobody knew who they were. “We’re big fans of not putting a ceiling on our ambitions. Whatever you could imagine is probably what we’re going for,” Joseph told me back in 2015. “It was a bit of a defence mechanism,” he admits today. “Josh [Dun] and I really did talk about what we wanted to accomplish when we started this band and so when it was all happening, we weren’t looking at each other and going ‘Can you believe this?’, we just kept saying ‘This is what we talked about.’” But there’s a big difference between talking about sold-out arena tours and actually spending two years on the road. “We weren’t really given any time to appreciate what was happening. We also didn’t allow ourselves to understand it, because it just seemed too overwhelming.” “It’s only now, talking to you, that we start to go ‘Wow, that album really was crazy.’ It was such an insane moment in our career.” Before the hype of “Stressed Out” had died down, Twenty One Pilots had another hit with “Heathens”, their prickly outsider anthem of community that had been written for the not-very-good Suicide Squad movie. It also set their stall out for what was to come next. Instead of chasing viral highs by repeating the many tricks they’d nailed on Blurryface, the band went deeper with knotty follow-up album Trench. The record rapidly expanded the lore to include a plucky band of freedom fighters rebelling against a gang of oppressive “bishops” in the fictional city of Dema and expanded the band’s sonic palette with emo, industrial metal and rap-rock. They headlined Reading and Leeds festival the following year and regularly sell out arenas across the world, but nothing has matched the success of Blurryface. “We didn’t realise how difficult it was to accomplish some of the things that we did with that album,” Joseph admits. After a detour into Eighties synth pop with Scaled and Icy, last year’s Clancy reached No 3 in the Billboard 200 (behind Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish) and acted as the conclusion to the Blurryface story. Does Joseph think there’s more for him to explore with Blurryface? “That’s a good question,” he replies, not wanting to give too much away. “That album is about cycles; trying to improve yourself, inevitably failing, and having to get back up and try again. We wrote it when we were in our twenties and now, 10 years later, there are still things we’re trying to figure out.” Whatever Twenty One Pilots do next, Blurryface continues to be a hugely influential record. Mouthy punk revivalist Yungblud, American hardrockers Halestorm, and TikTok darling James Marriott have all taken inspiration from the band, and they’ve got fans in Sean Paul, Muse and Billie Eilish. “I grew up on them. They have put out some incredible projects and said some of the most real things that I think I’ve ever heard,” Eilish said before the release of debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, which very much follows in the footsteps of Blurryface. A decade on, their fans are still dressing up in the latest battle paint, working together to decipher clues and sharing their own interpretations of the songs, the lore and the future. Despite the brooding subject matter, there’s a lot of hope in that community. “It absolutely changed rock music,” Emily Garner, Kerrang’s deputy editor and long-time member of Twenty One Pilots’ fanbase the Skeleton Clique, explains. Rock purists might hate them for further eroding genre lines and introducing trigger pads to the scene, but they also made alternative music a more experimental, open place. “To me, Blurryface’s impact is only a positive thing. [Tyler] Joseph’s words paved the way for other lyricists and their music opened up new doors for so many of today’s most exciting bands to walk through”. Twenty One Pilots also showed the industry that complicated concept records weren’t just for the overly nerdy portion of their fanbase. Nowadays, Ghost, Sleep Token and Bring Me the Horizon have all proudly built entire eras around complex narratives, and have been given the budget to flesh those ideas out. “We all want to get completely lost in these stories, and Twenty One Pilots proved that if you create honest, authentic worlds, there’ll be people out there who will wholeheartedly resonate.” Of course the success of Blurryface also comes down to a little bit of luck and a little bit of magic. Joseph calls the record “accidentally” great, while Dun says most of their confidence came from “encouraging” conversations with fans. “There is this pressure for new artists and legacy acts to keep casting their net wide to collect as many new ears as possible,” Joseph continues, reflecting on the album’s legacy. “But in doing that, you can sometimes forget the people that are already your fans. Blurryface was a good lesson for us in the importance of the people who’ve already said ‘Yes, I’m in.’” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-18
Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"At Eurovision, politics once more intrudes upon this former pop lark",https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/eurovision/eurovision-2025-review-uk-israel-austria-b2753000.html,"Viewers had plenty of time to revel in the bombastic anguish and madcap pop schemes on former ‘The Voice’ rejects, but politics still overshadows Eurovision’s post-war ideals I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice “We’re off to the races!” declares Graham Norton as the camp action gets underway at Basel’s St Jakob arena in Switzerland. And thus it falls once more to Eurovision to sashay into the bloody-toothed geopolitical scrum, plonk down a boombox playing the Vengaboys and try to get a savage world to sing about saunas for four hours. The ‘Vision, with its post-war ideals of unity through cheese-pop, wasn’t made for violent division within its ranks, nor at all ready for it. In recent, turbulent years it has become as much an international PR exercise as song contest, pinioned by its supposed non-political ethos as its participants make it ever more overtly political. This year, as in 2024, the main source of controversy is Israel’s involvement in the event through contestant Yuval Raphael. You might call it war-washing. You might argue that a global TV audience of 180 million should sense the level of solidarity abroad for the suffering Palestinian civilians, even through the TV feed’s “audio-sweetened” crowd noise. But there’s a sour note to what Norton calls “a mixed response” of cheers and jeers for Raphael herself on the night – a survivor of the 7 October terrorist attack on the Nova music festival who was selected by public vote as something of a national heroine. The song given to her by committee, “New Day Will Rise”, might even reflect the hopes of the general Israeli public for compassion, peace and renewal. “Everyone cries, don’t cry alone,” Raphael sings amid much Broadway bombast and slashes of Middle Eastern strings. “Life will go on… darkness will fade, all the pain will go.” That said, to sing it on an opulent, crystal-drenched staircase while our newsfeeds are full of emaciated Palestinian children in bombed-out homes still feels like a provocative move. “New day will rise,” great. But for everyone? Thankfully, producers have put Raphael on fourth, allowing plenty of time afterwards for viewers to pack their brains into cold storage and revel in the bombastic anguish and madcap pop schemes of the continent’s many regional The Voice rejects. Another major relief is that there’s been a significant scaling back in the sort of occult folk horror presentations that, since Sweden’s xenomorph crossbreed Loreen won in 2023, have made recent Eurovisions prime recruitment drives for Golden Dawn. The only serious hold-outs are Latvia’s Tautumeitas, six fire goddesses full of smiling menace, singing of “curses and hexes” and nature consuming the modern world, then growing monkey tails. The title of their glitch pop chorale “Bur Man Laimi” might translate as “A Chant for Happiness” but it sounds like an ominous evocation for Dead Can Dance to rise again and claim our souls. Instead, a sci-fi fantasy vibe prevails. Opening the evening, Norway’s Kyle Alessandro resembles Elliot Page starring in a musical Dune, roaming an Arabian pop volcano in post-apocalyptic warlord garb, flanked by hand-spinning mercenaries. Ziferblat, Ukraine’s elven village of an entry, resemble a Legends of Zelda game having come to life and become obsessed with the band Yes. And Poland’s Justyna Steczkowska and her crew of moon-worshipping S&M savages are even strafed by a fire-breathing dragon as she sings the song of the goddess Gaia herself, “creator of your DNA, your soul’s destruction and your salvation”. And an eternal deity who’s made it here having previously placed 18th in 1995 and co-hosted Polish Dancing on Ice. The theme for 2025, it seems, is The Elements. Fire and ice pyro and visuals abound, and there’s an entire nautical themed section an hour in. Austria’s impressive soprano JJ – looking to replicate the opera-pop success of last year’s winner Nemo – sets sail into stormy ballad waters on a boat made from bedroom detritus, giving his “Wasted Love” big cologne advert energy. Then Iceland’s Væb – dubbed the Viking Jedward – offer up some cheerier, cheesier seafaring fare with a song about rowing to Greenland on a Minecraft boat beneath leaping Lego dolphins. Later, Greece’s bespectacled chanteuse Klavdia sings of a mother mourning her daughter on the haunting “Asteromasta” while standing on a black pier above burning water. Ahab pop ahoy? In more traditional Eurovision quarters, The Netherlands’ Claude is the sole representative of the once ubiquitous overblown soul-pop balladeer, his “C’est La Vie” a poignant tale of his asylum seeker mother singing to him as a child, performed to his younger self in a mirror. The pop divas put on a strong fem-power showing. Luxembourg’s Laura Thorn, a marionette in a retro-futurist treehouse operated by giant CGI hands, delivers a superbly catchy cartoon twist on Sabrina Carpenter’s biting showgirl feminism. Malta’s Miriana Conte might have had her cunning ploy to slip the queer culture phrase “serving c***” into Eurovision foiled when the BBC insisted the easily-misheard original title of her entry “Kant” be changed to “Serving”, but she injects copious “queen energy” into its rap-pop celebration of forging one’s own riotous path. And, who knows, maybe the line “Why should we let other people decide when we could be having the time of our lives?” might somehow further the Europe-wide case for Universal Basic Income. Denmark’s Sissal seems to be singing the goth-flecked EDM of “Hallucination” from the depths of a K-hole meltdown – all blurred vision, paranoia and lack of control. Yet, love being her drug, she trips jubilant balls throughout. And Erika Vikman, representing both Finland and the more specialist corners of OnlyFans, is a Teutonic rave rock dominatrix whose (ahem) rousing “Ich Komme” is basically a Euro-“WAP”. Having already promised “my gates are open” and “I’ll dance with you even a wedding waltz, but naked”, she ends up riding a giant, spark-spewing golden microphone stand howling a simultaneous orgasm of a chorus like a phenomenally horny Andrew WK: “I scream out loud ‘I’m coming’ and together we come”. A harsh lesson in watching Eurovision with your parents and the subtitles on. After which, the understatement of Switzerland’s Zoë Më seems a refreshing Eurovision revelation: just her, a beautiful swell of chamber ballad and an arena of phone lights. France’s Louane also knows that less is amour, singing her touching ode to finding purpose in motherhood “Maman” (having lost her own parents in childhood) from inside a simple egg-timer set. These are certainly welcome feminine contrasts to Armenia’s none-more-macho PARG, running across the stage to the Imagine Dragons-aping “Survivor” looking like he's fresh from a fight to the death atop Mad Max’s battle tanker. It's a premium year for rock entries too. Lithuania’s Katarsis are probably the finest austere grunge goths ever to brave this arena of garish gimmickry. And Italy’s Lucio Corsi – a cross between 1973 Brian Eno and a malnourished Scarlet Pimpernel – brings probably the best song of the night in “Volevo Essere Un Duro”. It’s a Ziggy Stardust glam rock cracker played on a mile-long piano. There’s even an enlivening rock-off between previous rave metal entrants Käärijä and Baby Lasagna in the pre-voting interval. A kind of Eurogonks Assemble. But what, you ask, of the nutters? Well, the less said about Estonia’s rubber-limbed, coffee-loving Tommy Cash and his flapper cabaret catalogue of Italian cliches the better, but “Bara Bada Bascu” from Sweden’s besuited sauna bros KAJ is hooky enough to stand a chance of becoming the first novelty track to ever win. Even our own Remember Monday do us proud, strutting around a wonky chandelier like Frozen doing a Queen medley about owning your most Hasselhoff-sized blackouts. They hold their own in the jury voting too – receiving douze points from a creepy Italian mouse puppet will rival Churchill’s most stirring speeches in our nation’s proud history – even if the baffling public votes rob them of the showing they deserve. Against the odds, and thanks in large part to Switzerland’s three mildly demented presenters being so proud of their country having invented LSD, for the best part of four hours the joyous Eurovision spirit prevails and the unruly world seems a glittering neon curtain away. Until, in what Norton describes as “the most tense voting we’ve ever sat through”, a huge public phone-vote turnout for Israel makes for a highly charged final stand-off between Israel and Austria, and politics once more intrudes upon this formerly big fun pop lark. Ultimately Austria’s JJ prevails, the second successive opera-pop winner. Expect future Eurovisions to be awash with tracks resembling rave remixes of Tosca. And for the event to become ever more about optics than earworms.",2025-05-18

Read our Privacy notice Sterrato comes to the Giro d’Italia today as stage nine of the 2025 edition takes in some Strade Bianche-esque gravel sectors. There are even some shared sectors with the famous Classic - won by Tadej Pogacar in dominant fashion this year - in Monteaperti and Pinzuto, and five gravel sectors in total, with the longest two both 9.3km. Starting in Gubbio and heading through the Tuscan countryside to Siena, this should be both a fascinating stage to watch and also an incredibly hectic one as all the riders - particularly the GC contenders - look to stay safe on the five sterrato sections. Gravel has no respect for the pink jersey and the risks of punctures, crashes, and mechanicals all feel heightened on the uneven ground, while the dangers of being caught out of position will mean an almighty fight to be at the front. Like Strade Bianche it’s very up and down but the biggest climb is early on at La Cima, a category three 52km in, with another in San Martino in Grania on a sterrato section with 35km or so to go until the finish line in Siena. Other key moments include today’s Red Bull kilometre, at the end of Colle Pinzuto, a 2.5km gravel sector with 14km to go. Six, four and two bonus seconds are on offer there which an enterprising breakaway may well hoover up - or the GC contenders may come into play. The iconic Piazza del Campo plays host to the finish at the end of 181km of racing. Stage nine is scheduled to start at 1pm local time (12pm BST) and should conclude by 5.30pm local time (4.30pm BST). Mathias Vacek has been superb on all terrain in this race so far and had a more relaxed day on stage eight so should have fresher legs, while Dylan van Baarle has a fine Classics palmares and looked lively in the breakaway on Saturday. Inevitably plenty of riders will fancy this one but we’re going to throw our weight behind Tom Pidcock: a former winner of Strade Bianche, he’s evidently in good form after a strong Spring Classics campaign and a third place on a tough uphill sprint finish on stage five to Matera, and he’s made it clear he’s targeting this one. The 25-year-old has never won a senior Giro stage and only has one Grand Tour stage to his name, the famous Alpe d’Huez scalp in 2022, and would no doubt dearly like to add to that.

Independent,Sports,Fisher suffers nightmare KO by Allen as score is settled in rematch,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing/fisher-allen-2-result-knockout-highlights-rematch-b2753072.html,"After Fisher won a controversial decision in December, Allen left no doubt on Saturday – stopping his friend at the end of round five, as the towel also came in I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Johnny Fisher was stopped by David Allen in the fifth round of their hotly anticipated rematch at London’s Copper Box Arena on Saturday. The pair met on home soil to settle the score, after a controversial result five months ago saw the scorecards declare Fisher the winner in Riyadh. In their first clash, Fisher emerged victorious on two of the judges’ scorecards with tight margins of 95-94. The third judge scored it 96-93 in favour of Allen, underlining just how closely matched the two heavyweights were that night. History repeated itself as Allen delivered a knockdown yet again in the fifth round – two this time, in fact. But, unlike the first time out, Fisher was put down for good on this occasion, as the second knockdown proved decisive right on the bell. The arena floor was bouncing as Fisher was announced in the ring, and as the bout played out, the “Romford Bull Army” continued to echo Fisher’s name around the venue. Fisher, who was pegged as the favourite to win, was doubling up on shots in the second round as he landed uppercuts to Allen’s body, but he was soon warned for tapping Allen on the head. Allen came back with some jab action, but the 33-year-old wasn’t bringing speed as his 26-year-old opponent was. From the corner, before round three, Allen told coach Jamie Moore, “I’ll be quicker,” before finding himself up against the ropes. Yet it was largely the “White Rhino” fighting on the front foot. Fisher looked like he was hurting Allen with numerous body shots, but during the fourth round his promise to Moore rang true, as Allen landed his first clean shot to the top of Fisher’s head. The fighters took opportunities thereafter, the bout intensifying as a left hook to the body landed for Allen and a right hook to the head landed for Fisher.

The gruelling bout ultimately ended in round five, with a ferocious left hook sealing victory for Allen, who was left hungry for a win after the nature of his defeat in Saudi Arabia. Fisher could just not find his feet after the swift first knockdown in the fifth, and the second knockdown – on the bell, as the towel came in – proved decisive. With that, the result was not so controversial this time around. Allen refrained from celebrating, despite breaking his opponent’s unbeaten record, as paramedics immediately entered the ring to check on Fisher. Fisher was thankfully fine after some minutes, and the friends shared an embrace as the arena waited for Allen to receive his first title: the WBA Intercontinental heavyweight belt.

Read our Privacy notice Jasmine Paolini became the first home winner of the Italian Open for 40 years with a dominant victory over Coco Gauff. The 29-year-old, who reached the final of the French Open and Wimbledon last year in a breakthrough season, delighted the fans at the Foro Italico with a 6-4 6-2 success. No Italian had won one of the two singles titles in Rome since Raffaella Reggi back in 1985 but Paolini thoroughly merited her triumph, while Jannik Sinner could make it a home double when he faces Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday. Paolini came out firing and edged a tight first set before running away with the second amid a slew of Gauff errors. By winning the title, Paolini guaranteed she will overtake Iga Swiatek to become world number four on Monday and therefore obtain a top-four seeding for the French Open, which begins next weekend. Gauff has returned to form on the European clay after a difficult few months but has finished runner-up in both the major events, with this loss following one against Aryna Sabalenka in Madrid a fortnight ago. Katie Boulter, meanwhile, reached the first clay-court final of her career at the Trophee Clarins in Paris. Dropping down to WTA 125 level, the tier just below the main tour, has paid off for the British number one, who defeated France’s Varvara Gracheva 6-0 3-6 6-3 to set up a final clash with another home player, Chloe Paquet.
