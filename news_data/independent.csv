Independent,Business,BlackRock’s billions show it’s not all gloom for UK business,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/stock-markets-blackrock-interest-rates-uk-b2739490.html,"Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism, as Karl Matchett reports I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The mood around UK business has ranged from cautious to desperate in the past few months as the economy battles inflation, tax grabs, rising labour costs and the prospects of US tariffs. Add in constant political pressures giving a bleak outlook and the stock market plummeting in early April on the back of those tariffs, and UK plc could be forgiven for thinking 2025 might become a year to forget. But perhaps all is not as bad as it was beginning to appear, with some important signs giving relief and optimism to some businesses who got a share price backing boost thanks to the world’s biggest investor, BlackRock, building stakes in multiple companies. And the most imminent boost will be a cut to interest rates. The Bank of England meets on 8 May and a 0.25 per cent cut appears all but guaranteed at this stage. And back-to-back rates cuts are entirely possible, bringing the Bank Rate down to 4 per cent by summer. It would be the first time since March 2023 that the interest rate returns to that level, easing costs for business owners with debt and perhaps allowing more consideration to investment on projects and other spending which could spark opportunities for the growth the economy desperately needs. Some businesses already look well-positioned to capture that growth, believes Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock. “[The company has] allocated more capital back to the UK tactically now with the belief that in the short run, the new administration is trying to tackle some of the hard issues,” Mr Fink toldThe Times. “I think the prime minister is articulating the needs of what we have to do. I have more confidence in the UK economy today than I did a year ago.” Pointing to some of the financial institutions that had seen their share price hammered this year as the FTSE 100 dropped along with other major stock markets, Mr Fink explained how BlackRock had taken stakes in different sectors in the belief the selloff was overdone. “So many of the UK stocks discounts were too deep, especially like in the banking system. Look at the rebound in the valuations of NatWest and Lloyds and how they bounced. We added to our positions across the board with the idea that we believe the market was discounting too much negativity. And we believe the negativity was probably not warranted,” he said. Having seen a significant drop from 3 April onwards, the FTSE 100 - the biggest firms on the London Stock Exchange - have bounced back somewhat and now remain up more than two per cent since the start of 2025, even if they have collectively not reached March’s high points. Interest rate drops - while affecting households in terms of mortgages, savings accounts and so on - also impact investing. That is in part due to lower guaranteed returns from cash or like-cash holdings, meaning more risk may be taken on in the form of stock market equities. Rising share prices help improve investor and business confidence, while consumers may then benefit from having more money in their own pockets if rate drops mean they pay less on mortgages and other debt. There are further positives in other sectors. Retail sales rose almost half a percent in the UK during March, and that came ahead of April when the rise to minimum wage kicked in meaning more money in some workers’ pockets. Jacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said: “Glimpses of warmer weather and improving consumer confidence meant retail sales continued its upward trend in March. Sales volumes rose for the third consecutive month, reaching their highest level since July 2022. The first quarter of 2025 suggests consumer spending is slowly starting to return, which should provide some reason for optimism in the retail sector.” Then there’s analysis from Barclays, showing both wage growth easing and contraction in employment. Both of these factors will further ease pressure on the Bank of England when it comes to deciding rates cuts. Small wins they might seem, and with little impact of individuals, but as we so often see in businesses, it’s those small wins adding up continuously which lead to the potential to outperform. Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism.

Independent,Business,Why Tesla’s fall forced Musk to step back from DOGE,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/tesla-elon-musk-doge-profits-share-price-stock-b2737802.html,"A 71 per cent drop in profits and tanking share price have forced Elon Musk to cut down his time as Trump’s costcutter-in-chief. Alicja Hagopian and Karl Matchett explore what happened I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice At the start of the year, Tesla’s share price was at an all-time high. Elon Musk, owner of the electric vehicle giant, was coasting on the win of his ally Donald Trump, and investors were hedging their bets that soon-to-be-President Trump would enact policies in favour of Tesla and the billionaire’s other companies. But with an astronomical fall in share price, tanking sales and shrinking profits, the reality for Tesla has been far different – and much of it is tied to Musk’s public-facing role in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla stock once made up the majority of Musk’s wealth, but now it is reporting huge drops in profit. The decision to step away from DOGE may show that Musk is not immune to Tesla’s downfall. Within one month of Musk’s appointment to DOGE, Tesla shares were down 16.5 per cent. Within two, Tesla’s share price was down 45 per cent from when Trump came into office. And Musk himself has lost an estimated $149 billion in wealth since taking the helm at DOGE; at $301 billion compared to $449 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Tesla’s share price problems have been far from cosmetic. The business is facing significant headwinds, not least because of the intertwined reputation with its notorious leader. In January and February, Tesla sales in Europe saw sudden dips, of 45 per cent and 39 per cent respectively year-on-year - despite steady growth in the European electric vehicle (EV) market. The numbers behind this week’s latest earnings reports are, as expected, not pretty. Quarterly profits of $409m contrasted starkly with last year’s $1.4bn figure for the same three months - and the 71 per cent drop represents the company’s lowest quarterly profits since 2020. Actual vehicle sales reported this month were down 13 per cent to a little over a third of a million across the January to March quarter, with notable declines in China and parts of the US, while revenue of $19.3bn fell short of forecasts by more than $2bn and operating margins fell to 2.1 per cent. “Earnings margin of 2.1 per cent is the lowest since Tesla approached break-even in 2019,” said Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “Free cash flow dipped to $660 million, but did not enter negative territory as capital expenditures were nearly halved compared to the prior year due to reduced investments. “Tesla has [also] effectively removed its growth guidance for this year, no longer promising a return to growth in 2025.” Additional factors affecting sales include competition from China’s BYD (Build Your Dreams), which undercuts Tesla on price, while frequent recalls of Tesla vehicles may also be doing little to boost confidence in the brand. But it is impossible to ignore a major factor impacting its brand: Musk’s growing unpopularity. Musk has made no secret of his increasingly controversial political viewpoints. From accusations of a nazi salute at the inauguration, to criticising Volodmyr Zelensky as “evil” over the war in Ukraine, it is easy to see how his actions have ruffled feathers. As a result, a string of attacks have targeted Teslas in Europe and the US over the past few months, with clear anti-Musk messages. Tesla owners have faced threats to sell their cars over “Nazi Extremism” in California, while even in the UK, campaign groups have applied pressure against Tesla cars and charging points. Tesla shareholders are pushing back against Musk’s alignment with Trump; his decision to step partly away from DOGE indicates Musk is likely feeling the blowback himself. Investors may have hoped that Musk’s role in the administration would see carveouts for Tesla in Trump’s trade war. But in fact, the electric vehicle brand is far from immune. Tesla manufactures its electric vehicles in the US, which makes it less exposed to 25 per cent automotive tariffs than foreign brands. But the tariffs are not just on finished cars; there is also a 25 per cent levy on all imported automotive parts, and Tesla relies on many parts imported from China, in addition to Mexico and Canada: the company is dependent on imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to fuel its EVs, in particular using Chinese manufacturer CATL to supply its factories. And China’s new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets have also impacted other projects from Tesla such as its Optimus humanoid robots. With Tesla dependent on batteries and rare earth products from China, the trade war will inevitably hit its supply chain. Following Tesla’s plummeting profits, it might have been expected that the share price could drop further - but the opposite has happened. On Tuesday, the share price had risen 4.6 per cent; following the announcement of Mr Musk’s intentions to resume greater oversight of corporate rather than Capitol Hill activities, that trajectory continued. Tesla shares are up more than seven per cent in pre-trading, set to open well above $250 per share - still a far cry from December’s peak. Lowered expectations can explain part of it, as well as a broader desire from investors to see a bull run resume - from lower share price starting points. “Tesla’s first-quarter delivery and production numbers were as ugly as its Cybertruck design. That meant expectations were rock-bottom in the run-up to its financial results and it’s why the shares didn’t tank upon release of the Q1 earnings,” noted Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. “Certain individuals are spotting an opportunity and might take the view that Tesla’s significant share price decline has gone too far - they’re buying on the dip, hoping for a bounce-back and might view the recent sell-off as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pick up shares in a previous stock market darling on the cheap. After all, the fundamentals still give bulls something to get excited about.” Not everyone is quite as excited about those humanoid robots, self-driving taxis and energy storage products though. “While Tesla is making progress on these initiatives, we believe the market and management commentary are overly optimistic about the timing. The narrative around Tesla’s stock and valuation remains heavily dependent on these future prospects,” Valechha cautioned. It should also be noted, the uptick isn’t totally down to Tesla, Musk or anything to do with electrification - Trump’s China tariff climbdown has sent the S&P 500 two per cent higher in pre-trading, with the likes of Amazon and Nvidia up four per cent each. Market volatility comes as standard in this second Trump term, and for Tesla which inadvertently became a crossover company to the political arena, that continues to go double.

Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer’s ambassador in Washington has said he is “looking forward” to negotiating with the US to “bring down further tariffs”. Lord Peter Mandelson told the BBC that Thursday’s deal represents a “platform for going further and opening up more trade opportunities”, as the Prime Minister declined to rule out the possibility of changes to tech taxes in a future trade deal. On Friday, Donald Trump’s press secretary insisted that the president will stand firm on the blanket 10% tariff on most UK imports into the US, telling reporters that he is “committed” to the levy. The deal announced on Thursday cut taxes on car imports of 100,000 a year from 27.5% to 10%, and also reduced tariffs on steel and aluminium through quotas. The baseline 10% rate for other goods remains in place but officials are still trying to negotiate on it. Lord Mandelson told Newsnight: “I’m very pleased with what we’ve achieved. It’s taken many months of very tough negotiation, and it’s also a platform going further and opening up more trade opportunities.” He added: “We’re going to negotiate further and bring down further tariffs and remove further barriers to trade between us, that’s what we’re committed to, and I’m looking forward to doing that.” Karoline Leavitt told a White House press briefing that the US president is “committed to the 10% baseline tariff” imposed in April “not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well”. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told reporters on Thursday that the UK’s conversations with the US about “those wider tariff lines and the 10% reciprocal tariff” were continuing. It comes as Sir Keir Starmer did not rule out the possibility of changes to the digital services tax as part of any future trade agreement and said that discussions on other aspects are “ongoing”. It imposes a 2% levy on the revenues of several major US tech firms. Previous speculation suggested that the UK could revise the measure as part of a deal. Speaking to broadcasters on board HMS St Albans during a visit to Norway, Sir Keir said: “The deal that we signed off yesterday doesn’t cover that. “That’s predominantly focused on steel and aluminium, and reducing those tariffs on car manufacturing and reducing the tariffs there, and then future-proofing for pharmaceuticals, three really important sectors, and that, as I say, will be measured in thousands and thousands of jobs that will be protected, saved and will thrive as a result of this. “On digital services, there are ongoing discussions, obviously, on other aspects of the deal, but the important thing to focus on yesterday is the sectors that are now protected that the day before yesterday were very exposed.” Lord Mandelson said that digital services were brought up during the negotiations for this week’s agreement, and told the BBC that “what they suggested wasn’t acceptable to us, so it’s not in the deal”. The deal on Thursday is the first struck by the US since the new tariffs were unveiled last month, and comes after weeks of transatlantic talks. Sir Keir told the Independent that he has “struck up a good relationship” with the president. “I am the sort of person that tries to have constructive and positive relations with people,” he said. Kemi Badenoch has said she is “concerned” about the prospects of the UK going on to strike a full free trade agreement in the wake of Thursday’s agreement. Speaking to reporters during a visit in Essex on Friday, the Conservative leader was asked whether she thought Thursday’s deal was a success. “It’s not a huge success at all,” she said. “It’s not even a trade deal, it’s a tariff deal, and we are in a worse position now than we were six weeks ago. “It’s better than where we were last week, so it’s better than nothing, but it’s not much. “One of the things that concerns me is that we will probably now not get a comprehensive free trade agreement.”",2025-05-10

Independent,Politics,Digitising NHS and adult social care ‘will cost £21bn over the next five years’,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-health-foundation-government-england-department-of-health-and-social-care-b2746961.html,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Digitising NHS and social care will cost £21 billion over the next five years, but could be vital for driving down waiting lists, according to new research. A report said the UK will need to spend billions to fully implement electronic patient records, cloud storage, cyber security and wi-fi, with the skills and capabilities needed to use them. The Health Foundation charity commissioned PA Consulting ahead of the forthcoming Government spending review, and publication of the 10-year health plan, to estimate the costs of making the transformation to digital services. The Government has pledged to move the health service from analogue to digital as part of its “three shifts” for the NHS, which also include moving care from hospitals to communities and preventing sickness. In the new report, estimates suggest that £8 billion of capital spending (of which £5 billion is for England) is needed for things like hardware, software and electronic patient records. A further £3 billion would be one-off revenue spending (of which £2.25 billion is for England), for planning, initial education and training, implementation of new technologies and transition from old systems. Some £2 billion recurring annual spending (of which £1.5 billion per year is for England) over five years is also needed for ongoing training, software subscriptions, maintenance, improvement and optimisation. Recurring costs will then carry on beyond the five-year period. According to the Health Foundation, while it may be possible to cover some of the costs from existing budgets, it is highly likely the Government will need to commit additional funding. Tom Hardie, senior improvement fellow at the Health Foundation, said: “Digitisation is going to be really critical for the NHS and social care to be sustainable and fit for the 21st century. “When we talk about waiting times in particular, I think there are hopes that digitisation could help to address waiting times. “Within this research, we haven’t set out to define or quantify the benefits of digitisation, but I think it’s possible to say that digitisation could theoretically help to reduce waiting times. “So, for example, making it easier and simpler for people to get appointments or to cancel and rebook appointments. “It could help to optimise (operating) theatre schedules, improve prevention of acute episodes of care through remote monitoring of people with health conditions, improved triage processes to help direct people to the right services first time (and) perhaps avoiding more resource-intensive services like A&E.” Making the NHS more digitally capable will also free up staff time, he said. Figures suggest that medics lose more than 13.5 million hours a year because of inadequate or malfunctioning IT. Dr Malte Gerhold, director of innovation and improvement at the Health Foundation, said: “Our independently commissioned research finds that to achieve the Government’s ambitions to digitise health and social care, significant spending will be needed over the next five years and beyond. “But direct investment in technology alone is not sufficient. “The Government must fund the change not just the tech. This means investing in and planning for implementation and change to genuinely realise the benefits of digitisation for patients and staff.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the private sector is 15 years ahead of the NHS on technology, adding: “This Government is bringing our analogue NHS into the digital age, to improve the productivity of the NHS, deliver better care for patients and better value for taxpayers. “We are already making significant progress by introducing cutting-edge AI and technology to support clinicians and improve care, reforming the NHS app to give patients more control, and centralising patient records to speed up diagnosis and treatment. “This is only possible because of the increase in employers’ national insurance, which allowed us to invest an extra £26 billion for health and social care.”",2025-05-10

Read our Privacy notice Donald Trump has unveiled a ""historic agreement"" with the UK, the culmination of Sir Keir Starmer’s months-long charm offensive towards the US president. A month after his so-called Liberation Day tariffs began to bite, Britain has now achieved a series of significant carve-outs from sweeping tariffs on UK carmakers, steelworks and farmers. The deal is a major boost for the prime minister, coming hot on the heels of a trade agreement between the UK and India this week. Donald Trump said the agreement with the UK is a “great deal for both countries”, while Sir Keir said “this is a really fantastic, historic day” as he spoke to the US president about the deal on the phone. Here, The Independent looks at how different sectors of Britain’s economy will be affected. The deal, which the UK government has said will save “thousands of jobs”, will see car export tariffs slashed from 27.5 per cent to 10 per cent, for a quota of 100,000 UK cars. This, the government said, is almost the total the UK exported last year. The agreement is crucial as it will allow British carmakers to restart sales to the American market. Jaguar Land Rover had suspended US shipments in the wake of Mr Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariff announcements, and Sir Keir was keen to announce the trade deal at the company’s Solihull manufacturing plant to offer reassurance to workers at the firm and across the sector. Mr Trump’s 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium will be axed entirely, in a major boost for the beleaguered sector. The government last month took control of British Steel to prevent the closure of its Scunthorpe blast furnaces and hopes Thursday’s trade deal will keep the sector alive. The two governments have negotiated new reciprocal market access on beef, giving UK farmers a tariff-free quota of 13,000 metric tonnes of meat. There are concerns that the new reciprocal market access on beef could lead to a decline in food standards. However, the UK government insisted that there will be “no weakening of UK food standards on imports”, amid concerns a deal could pave the way for the import of hormone-treated beef from the US. Donald Trump also played down concerns that it could open up UK markets to chlorine-washed chicken, saying the UK will “take what they want” when it comes to US beef and chicken imports, rather than being forced to accept lower standards. US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins added: “Specific to the beef, this is going to exponentially increase our beef exports. And to be very clear, American beef is the safest, the best quality, and the crown jewel of American agriculture for the world.” A consistent red line in negotiations has been food standards, amid fears a trade deal could open Britain’s doors to hormone-injected beef and chlorinated chicken. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and chancellor Rachel Reeves have both ruled out lowering Britain's food standards to get a deal over the line, in a boost to struggling farmers. The government also failed to secure carve-outs for tariffs on pharmaceuticals and the remaining 10 per cent reciprocal tariffs imposed on Britain. The government said “work will continue” on those. There have also been no concessions secured for the film and TV industry, after Mr Trump threatened to apply a 100 per cent levy on films made outside America, which the PM has been warned would devastate film and TV production in the UK. There were also concerns that the US was trying to win concessions on Britain’s digital services tax, paid by overseas search engines and social media sites on revenues from the UK. But today’s deal saw the tax left unchanged. A change to the tax would have been a boost to major American firms such as Amazon, Facebook owner Meta and Google owner Alphabet. Instead, the two nations have agreed to work on a digital trade deal that will strip back paperwork for British firms trying to export to the US - something the government said would open the UK up to a “huge market that will put rocket boosters on the UK economy”. Tariffs on ethanol, which Downing Street wrongly claimed is used to produce beer, have been removed entirely. In addition to this, Downing Street has also said that the US has agreed to give the UK “preferential treatment” in any further tariffs imposed as part of Section 232 investigations - a process where the US government determines if certain imports threaten US national security.

Alicja Hagopian, David Maddox and Archie Mitchell explain I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump are on the brink of announcing a new trade deal after nearly five years of negotiations. The previous government began discussions for a free trade agreement in May 2020 with then-president Joe Biden’s administration. Now, Mr Trump has said ""major trade deal"" will be announced with a ""highly respected country"" on Thursday, widely believed to be a reference to the UK. Sir Keir's spokesman has promised an update from the prime minister on Thursday, too, all but confirming a deal has been done. While the UK initially received the lowest possible tariff rate under Mr Trump's trade war, with 10 per cent taxes applied on exports to the United States, it was later left at the same rate as the rest of the world. But Thursday's announcement confirms a coup for Sir Keir, with his fawning diplomatic approach to Mr Trump appearing to have paid off. Sir Keir Starmer’s government has made no pretence over the fact that it is not looking for a traditional comprehensive trade deal. Instead, it is pushing for an agreement based around the growth of “future” industries, such as biotech, new pharmaceuticals and artificial intelligence. The proposal is that the UK and US research base, coupled with the money markets in New York and London, would create a powerhouse for the latest industrial revolution, which could shape the future of the world. The US largely embraces this idea, but there are caveats, and the negotiations have been complicated by President Trump’s tariffs. While a final deal would see close integration for those future growth industries, it now would also mean deals on more traditional areas to remove tariffs altogether. The biggest issue – as is often the case – will be how far it affects agricultural products. Mr Trump’s team would like the UK to allow chlorinated chicken or beef with added hormones. But the UK does not want to go this far. There could also be demands for the UK to repeal legislation on tech controls, which the White House says affects free speech. In the end, the quick deal will be closer to the UK vision on future growth technologies, but the ongoing question is how much Sir Keir will have to compromise in other areas. The US continues to be Britain’s largest single-country trading partner, followed by Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and France. As a bloc, trade with the EU is significantly higher. The UK has nearly no trade imbalance with the US when it comes to goods, exporting £59.3bn and importing £57.2bn in 2024. This has likely contributed to the fact that Britain has not been in Mr Trump’s firing range when it comes to extra tariffs – and why a trade deal is on the cards. Currently, the UK is facing a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the US. British automotive and steel exports are taking a stronger blow, with a separate 25 per cent levy on sales to the US market. Cars are Britain’s single largest export to the US, valued at £8.3bn in the year up to November 2024. The US is also the top buyer of domestic cars, from Aston Martin to Mini; though British brand Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is the most at risk from tariffs, with the US being its top sales market. This has been a point of tension between Sir Keir and Mr Trump, as negotiations to exempt the UK from these industry-specific tariffs have so far fallen short. Other industrial exports are also high on the list, with £5.3bn in mechanical power generators and £2.3bn in aircraft sent to the US last year. Meanwhile, the UK’s health and scientific industries are also reliant on the US market. The UK sent vaccines, medicines and other pharmaceutical products worth £7.3bn to the US last year, and £2.4bn in scientific instruments like microscopes and X-ray equipment. Britain buys billions in medical and pharmaceutical products from the US, too, meaning that both industries are significantly intertwined, with health secretary Wes Streeting warning that tariffs could pose challenges. The UK only imports around £100m in animal products from the US, a point of contention for Mr Trump, who has urged Britons to buy more chlorinated and hormone-treated animal products such as beef and chicken. Meanwhile, crude oil is Britain’s leading import from the US, at £8.6bn in the 12 months up to November 2024. President Trump has suggested in the past that buying more American oil and gas could be a way to curry favour in the global trade war. Services are perhaps the most significant element of UK-US trade, representing some £179bn in services exchanged between the two countries. The UK benefits from an open relationship with the US, exporting twice as many services (£124bn) as it imports (£55bn). This includes £52.3bn across various business services, £27.8bn in financial services, and £11bn in insurance and pensions. Perhaps most importantly, with regards to the new trade deal, the UK exports £10.3bn in telecoms, tech and IT services across the pond – and imported £3.5bn last year. The tech industry – in particular AI, biotech and quantum – is on the agenda for UK-US negotiations, as both sides seek to deepen their ties in so-called “future industries”. On a visit to California last month, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle met with US tech leaders, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Nvidia, touting Britain as a global hub for AI investment. Both countries have been aligned on tech for some time and have expressed their intentions to steamroll ahead on AI. In February, both the UK and the US refused to sign an international agreement on AI, which aimed to make development “open”, “inclusive”, and “ethical”. While the UK cited national security concerns, the US said that overregulation would “kill a transformative industry”. Less than one year earlier, both countries – under different governments – had announced a partnership on AI safety.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,How MobLand completely ruined the UK’s favourite swear word,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/mobland-swearing-guy-ritchie-pierce-brosnan-b2745698.html,"The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Profanity has always been the heart and soul of Guy Ritchie’s tough guy offerings, but his new Paramount show is saturated in so many c-words that it may just have ushered in the death of swearing. Helen Coffey mourns the senseless dilution of our most beloved curse word I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice When I started watching MobLand, Guy Ritchie’s new London gangster drama featuring an all-star cast including Dame Helen Mirren, Tom Hardy and Pierce Brosnan, I initially thought the most ridiculous thing in it was the accents. There’s Brosnan’s preposterous “Irish” brogue for starters – even more inexplicable when you consider that the man actually is Irish – an amalgamation of every terrible “top o’ the mornin’ to ya!” impression you’ve ever heard, and arguably even worse than his much-mocked turn in the 1988 film Taffin. Then there’s Mirren’s equally scattergun attempt at convincing us she hails from the Emerald Isle, not to mention the myriad botched cockney dialects that frequently threaten to tip over into full Dick Van Dyke territory. But before long, another element in the buzzy new Paramount show, centred around the Harrigan crime family, vied for top dog in the “suspend your disbelief” Olympics. The first time it happened was nine minutes and 45 seconds into episode one: the c-word, flung out in a gritty East End nightclub, the mobster equivalent of a glove slap as the precursor to a duel. Another one landed five seconds later. A third swiftly followed. A brief spell of furious running from Eddie Harrigan (Anson Boon), and then “c***” number four slid into view. At first, I took it in my stride. These are professional criminals, I reasoned; a little potty-mouthed dialogue is par for the course when you’ve got a load of hardmen trying to out-hard each other while strutting around and flashing weaponry. Yet the repetition quickly became so frequent it began to feel a little… farcical. Silly, even. The word resembled an arbitrary punctuation mark, a kind of lazy shorthand for “Look at us – we’re ever so tough!” Without even realising I was doing it, I stopped paying attention to the story and switched my focus to counting the “c***s”. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine… They stopped just shy of double digits in episode one, but I was on a roll now. I continued tallying with a kind of horrified fascination, as if doing an 18-rated version of Count von Count from Sesame Street’s schtick. Episode two saw a dip in usage, with only two during the entire 50-minute runtime, but by episode three we were back, baby: another nine, shoehorned in with all the subtlety of a brick lobbed through a freshly glazed window. The undisputed winner, though, was episode five, the “c***”s coming thick and fast to reach a dizzying total of 11 – the equivalent of one every three minutes. Five of these were uttered in the final eight minutes alone. The word is used indiscriminately by nearly every character in the show, upon any and every occasion. Feeling lethally angry towards someone? Call them a c***. Mildly aggrieved? Call them a c***. Affectionate? Call them a c***. Sorry for them? Call them a poor c***. It would make an effective drinking game – take a shot every time you hear the c-word! – but only if your real aim was to end the evening in A&E getting your stomach pumped. It’s like someone fed Peter Cook and Dudley Moore’s infamous Derek and Clive Live “This Bloke Came Up To Me” sketch – which contains an awe-inspiring 36 “c***”s within the space of three minutes and 40 seconds – into ChatGPT and asked it to burp out a 10-part gangster drama. By the time I’d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word, let alone the most potent one in the English language. I had to catch myself before saying it casually to my mum on the phone; my boss over Slack; the unsuspecting woman on the checkout at Asda. I had to remind myself that calling someone a “c***” is not, in fact, an appropriate response to every situation. Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 day New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

The c-word has long been the undisputed king of swears, one that wields the mightiest power to offend, titillate and make people laugh depending on timing and context. The oldest word for female genitalia in the English language, this is profanity with some historical clout (though, admittedly, it wasn’t offensive back in the 13th century when its first usage was recorded). It may be too much for many Americans’ tastes, and have been watered down into a neutral or complimentary term by the Aussies (see: “He’s a good c***”), but most Brits hold the expletive in high esteem, understanding its expansive, unrivalled capacity to shock and endear. It’s no coincidence that The White Lotus’s English stars, Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood, both independently named it as their favourite curse word in recent interviews. By the time I’d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word Understand when and where to use it – shrewdly and with discernment – and it’s like carrying the sharpest, most adaptable blade in your lexiconic arsenal at all times. National treasure Kathy Burke is the master of this, able to deftly deploy “c***” with the precision and comedic timing it needs to hit a home run. By comparison, MobLand isn’t even attempting to make contact with the ball – simply lobbing bats across the field at random and hoping one of them hits something. I’m not annoyed by the proliferation of profanity because I’m offended by it. I’m annoyed because MobLand has taken this most special of curses, in all its jagged, ugly elegance, and flogged it to death, diluting it through overexposure and robbing it of its muscle. The sheer abundance of “c***”s ensures they don’t punch through or enhance the dialogue. Instead, they awkwardly stumble across the screen: flabby, toothless, a little embarrassing. It’s like seeing a once-proud empress dethroned and wandering the streets in rags. My heart aches for her. It’s ironic, in a way. In a drama dominated by senseless gangland killings, the murder of our beloved c-word turned out to be the most tragic of all.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,A 10 Things I Hate About You reboot without Heath Ledger is insanity,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/10-things-i-hate-about-you-reboot-heath-ledger-b2746364.html,"The director behind the 1999 teen classic has announced three sequels are in development, though sans the original’s biggest star Heath Ledger, who died in 2008. And it’s news that wildly misunderstands the appeal of the original, argues Adam White I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You remains one of the key definitions of a “star-is-born” performance. Tall, handsome, with blush-worthy levels of camera-ready magnetism, Ledger sauntered into pop-culture consciousness in 1999 as a chain-smoking (rumoured) bad boy teen paid to take an arty cool girl (the similarly luminous Julia Stiles) to prom. Allowed to retain his Aussie accent, Ledger is ludicrously charismatic in the film, all lackadaisical flirtation and alluring ambivalence. Can you even imagine 10 Things… without him? Well, imagine no more: a Heath-less reboot is in development. Is nothing sacred etc...? Despite celebrity death typically halting unasked-for revivals in their tracks (remember how close we got to a Mrs Doubtfire 2 in the months before Robin Williams’s death in 2014?), a trilogy of sequels to 10 Things I Hate About You is coming down the pipe. The original film’s director Gil Junger has confirmed that each new movie will explore different stages of adult life, which will be reflected in their respective titles: 10 Things I Hate About Dating; 10 Things I Hate About Marriage; and 10 Things I Hate About Kids. How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways. Junger said that he is open to cast members from the first film returning for “cameos” or “small parts”, mentioning Larry Miller by name – the actor who played father to Stiles’s moody wallflower. Absent, though, obviously, would be Ledger, who died in 2008 at the depressingly young age of 28. But don’t worry, Junger told People Magazine, it’d be “a beautiful idea” to somehow nod to Ledger in the new movies, adding: “He deserves to be loved.” Sure! But isn’t there something particularly grim about this, even for an age in which absolutely every bit of pre-existing intellectual property – The Bodyguard (maybe) with Taylor Swift! Single White Female with Jenna Ortega! Legally Blonde without Reese Witherspoon! – is being strip-mined for parts? 10 Things wasn’t a film led by its premise, which more or less mirrored the conventions of every other major teen movie in 1999, with its finding-love-through-deception, prom-night-entanglements, enemies-to-lovers, Shakespeare-aping silliness (as any GCSE English student will tell you, its plot was inspired by The Taming of the Shrew). What made it a generational classic was Ledger and Stiles, two preternaturally gifted young actors with intelligence and wit in spades, along with the particularly skilled cast that surrounded them (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gabrielle Union and David Krumholtz). And it was also down to the unusually thoughtful, character-driven script by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, who made sure that Stiles’s moody Kat Stratford was never shamed for being a snarky, alternative bookworm, or transformed – She’s All That-style – into something more aggressively conventional. Lutz and Smith are, at this point, not involved in the revival, suggesting this is very much a Gil Junger project. And you can hardly blame his eagerness. Junger, whose last significant movie was 2001’s Martin Lawrence medieval romp Black Knight, has been attempting to mount 10 Things reboots since 2009, first with a short-lived TV series inspired by the film (you probably don’t remember it either), then in 2012 with the film sequel 10 Things I Hate About Life starring Evan Rachel Wood. If that’s inspired you to say “huh?”, it’s because it never got finished – production was cancelled two months into filming. I understand the impulse for a filmmaker to try and further monetise his biggest hit, but 10 Things I Hate About You isn’t an incredibly flexible bit of IP that can exist as little more than a brand name. It is specific and singular, something only crystallised by the death of its biggest name. I also can’t see anyone being particularly interested in it, either. Without Ledger, there won’t even be the slim pleasure of watching old castmates reuniting (which seems to be the sole impetus behind the forthcoming Freakier Friday with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan). It’ll just be the most currently unemployed cast members from a perfect film from 25 years ago, vainly attempting to resurrect its magic – and what a miserable idea that is.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,"Here We Are charms, but Sondheim’s final musical feels incomplete",https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/here-we-are-stephen-sondheim-national-theatre-b2747848.html,"Familiar TV faces Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Jane Krakowski, and Rory Kinnear make up a formidable if unlikely cast A posthumous premiere from a composer so respected that his nickname is simply “God” is, to put it mildly, a pretty exciting prospect for musical theatre fans. And that’s before you factor in its formidable, if unlikely, cast. Transferring from off-Broadway to the National Theatre with a new lineup of actors, the late Stephen Sondheim’s Here We Are is a surreal apocalyptic comedy, which stars Jesse Tyler Ferguson (Modern Family) as a henpecked plastic surgeon, Harry Hadden-Paton (Downton Abbey) as a foot-fetishist bishop, and Jane Krakowski (30 Rock) as an interior designer wafting about cluelessly in a negligee. They just want to go for brunch. But the universe has other ideas, as this stylishly weird, unfinished musical descends into an existential satire of the feckless rich. As his career wore on, Sondheim became increasingly interested in using musical theatre as a space for psychological exploration, choosing abstracted, liminal settings for works such as Follies (1971) and Into The Woods (1986). Even so, we’re on strange, shifting ground here, with a story grafted together by playwright David Ives from two surrealist films from Spanish-Mexican director Luis Buñuel: The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Exterminating Angel. It follows a group of wealthy friends marauding around the city in search of something delicious to eat: Sondheim’s score is on urbane, jazzy form as they go to an array of bougie restaurants, only to have their appetites tormented by an empty kitchen, a chef’s funeral, and rubber food. Unusually, these friends mostly sing in chorus together (which explains the casting of stars who aren’t musical theatre regulars) with the solo songs coming from incidental characters such as Denis O’Hare’s beautifully rendered array of servile attendants. “The Waiter’s Song” is a jaunty comic delight, stuffed with Sondheim's signature wordplay: “We do expect a little latte later but we haven’t got a lotta latte now.” Ives’ script is full of wit, too, satirising the image-obsessed triviality of this crew: “Oh did I tell you, we’re getting the dogs cloned,” pronounces Krakowski’s character, who wants identical poodles to greet her in each of her many homes. Tony Award-winning director Joe Mantello throws body, soul, and a huge amount of cash into making this oddity work – David Zinn’s astonishingly lavish set design magics up an array of rooms that ought to be preserved in the Met, gorgeously gilded and mirrored, melting into each other and then into the bright, blinking white of nothingness when these friends’ meaningless lives melt away. It’s flip, funny, and undeniably stylish. But essentially unsatisfying, too. An exhaustive eight-page essay in the programme charts the musical’s four decade-long journey from idea to stage, its progress dogged by indecision, the lure of other projects, and procrastination (at one point, Sondheim claimed he couldn’t compose because of an ingrown toenail). In the end, Sondheim died before Here We Are was finished, meaning that the second half of the play is largely bereft of musical numbers. Instead, it descends into a locked-room drama where comfortable privilege descends into ugly anarchy, and rich man’s daughter Fritz (Chumisa Dornford-May) abandons her revolutionary principles in favour of a boot-cupboard tryst with a soldier as the world starts to burn. What’s being attempted here is an act of transubstantiation: the trivial turned into the profound, as these superficial friends are forced to reckon with death and immortality. But Sondheim was tragically unable to finish the songs that would elevate this musical into the transcendental thing it could be. Instead, it’s a beautifully rendered curio for his fans, full of wit and dash – and a testament to his restless search for meaning in the most unexpected of places.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Thom Yorke and Mark Pritchard’s album is full of existential jitters,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/thom-yorke-and-mark-pritchard-sculpt-tall-tales-into-an-alien-synthscape-b2747155.html,"The alienation and emotional askewness of the music is a perfect fit for Yorke’s lyrical themes I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice “Everybody, run, it looks like rain,” drawls Thom Yorke over the mechanised beat and lurid, tuba-aping synths of “Back in the Game”. The first single from the progtronic Tall Tales – the Radiohead frontman’s first full-length electronic collaboration with Yeovil-born producer/musician Mark Pritchard – offers disquieting fanfare for a dense, dystopian album. A record full of existential jitters, it addresses themes of human greed, mendacity, disconnection and the climate crisis. Vintage keyboard effects slip, slide and splash in looping melodies, like chunks of ice caps tumbling into the sea, while Yorke’s angsty vocal drifts at a sorrowful altitude. It is, of course, a myth that Yorke only became interested in electronic music when Radiohead were working on 2000’s Kid A. While it’s true that they asked experimental electronic label Warp to send them their entire catalogue in 1999, Yorke was already familiar with their early releases, having played them as a student in Exeter back when he was picking up DJ gigs. It makes sense. The alienation and emotional askewness of the genre is a perfect fit for Yorke’s lyrical themes, counterbalancing what he has irritably described as the “prettiness” of his voice. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the affable Pritchard explained that he’s been friends with Yorke since 2012 (when Radiohead toured Australia, where he’s based). They first collaborated on the elegiac “Beautiful People” for Pritchard’s Under The Sun album, released in 2016 (the same year Radiohead dropped their last – and final? – album A Moon Shaped Pool). Yorke emailed Pritchard again during the lockdown of 2020: trapped at home, he was looking for music he could tinker with remotely, having paused the more organic, band-based work of his other side-project, The Smile. Pritchard pinged back 20 rough tracks composed over the previous decade, and the pair set to work sculpting the strange alien synthscape that became Tall Tales. It’s a filmic sequence of 12 songs that scuttles into being with the sly, crablike bursts of beats and sulphurous, parping bass of “A Fake in a Faker’s World”. While Yorke’s falsetto reaches into the retro-synth, zero-gravity void for “the force that you cannot see/ Someone to look after me”, Pritchard artfully builds texture and momentum with insectoid percussion and panoramic organ effects that call back to Eighties-era Jean-Michel Jarre. Yorke’s vocals melt into distortion against the slo-mo repetitions of “Ice Shelf”. His voice ping-pongs from high to low registers against the arcade-style “pew-pew” effects of “Gangsters”, then reaches into a Seventies R&B rasp over the syncopated handclaps and soft splashes of 808 on “The Conversation is Missing Your Voice”. He channels his inner Lou Reed to drone-rap “We sign the papers/ We line their pockets” over the trippy harmonium, tambourine and muffled drums of “The Men Who Dance in Stag’s Heads”. The track conjures hollow-laugh visions of tech bros folk-dancing on the moon. At times, Yorke moonwalks into self-parody with lines such as, “What's the purpose?” But such sixth-formery is compensated by the gorgeous melody and elegant phrasing of “Bugging Out Again”, so beautiful it's hard to hear with your eyes open.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,The Surfer allows Nicolas Cage to go wild – then leaves him hanging,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-surfer-nicolas-cage-review-b2746391.html,"The actor plays a desperate businessman left stranded in the sweltering Australian heat in this manic thriller, but the film’s themes struggle to align with his go-for-broke performance I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The triggers for Nicolas Cage’s vengeful ire have grown increasingly obscure of late. Normally, he’s battling to get back his wife (2018’s Mandy), his daughter (2012’s Stolen), or his granddaughter (2011’s Drive Angry). Now he’s battling to get back his favourite hog (2021’s Pig) and, with The Surfer, his favourite longboard. Yet, these films, inevitably, offer the same sell: people come for the Cage-ness of it all, the bug-eyed grimace, the air karate chop, the erratic, ever-escalating inflection. It’s the inevitable metric by which they’re judged. But as Cage grows more violent over smaller transgressions, directors have offered him a little more room to work. The Surfer is what you might call a slow-burn Cage. There’s the manic, hollering prize at the end (and even a line of dialogue worthy of a future meme), but also plenty of the actor’s more undervalued speciality – the expression of gargantuan helplessness, the look of a fish who’s been thrown to land and left to die. Here, he plays an Australian-born, American-raised businessman returning to his birthplace with the intention of buying his family’s old beach home. Life has turned cruel for him: his estranged wife is shacked up with another man, his son (Finn Little) seems distant, and his boss is wondering why he turned up to their last meeting with no shoes or socks. The plan, then, is to come back and reroot himself, to reconstruct his innocence. Only, the second he turns up to his old surfing haunt, the local “Bay Boys” get up in his face and bellow, “don’t live here, don’t surf here”. He’s become a stranger to everywhere. When the Bay Boys swipe his surfboard, he’s left haunting the beach car park. Somehow he’s both unable and unwilling to leave, as he’s systematically stripped of his possessions and identity, dehydrated and near-starved to death in the sweltering Australian heat. “I have a car! I have a job! I have a name!” he cries. Ironically, we never do find out the last one in that list. It makes us feel complicit in his humiliation. Irish filmmaker Lorcan Finnegan is fluent in the language of disorientation. Every crash zoom, every leering close-up, every flash forward (or backward?), every mocking cutaway to Australian wildlife, every shot of a split bag of dog faeces strategically dropped on the water fountain – it all exists to push Cage’s character towards the expected endpoint of total insanity. Under the glare of Razek Ladczuk’s sun-baked cinematography, the actor’s skin has never looked more orange and his teeth so white. It’s effective. Finnegan has deployed such open-air claustrophobia multiple times before. In his second feature, Vivarium, Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg played a couple who move into a suburban development, only to realise they can never leave. Its ideas were whip-smart and coherent – the pair looked, essentially, like they were trapped in a René Magritte painting, forced to enact heteronormativity against their own will. Here, Thomas Martin’s script loads the ammo but fails to land the shot. The Surfer is about individualism and masculinity, about the desire to own and claim space. Julian McMahon plays Bay Boy leader Scally with a finely tuned mix of breezy confidence and open hostility, while wearing a red towel hoodie that could easily be mistaken for cultist’s robes. It’s pointed out that he is, to quote, a “trust fund bitch”, appropriating the bohemian beach lifestyle (and, at certain points, Aboriginal culture). But to what degree he and our protagonist share, or don’t share, in the vicious cycle of bro-hood feels hazy. The Surfer, instead, simply relinquishes control to Cage. That’s fine. It’s always a pleasure to see him lose it. Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 day New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial. Plan auto-renews until cancelled. ADVERTISEMENT.

Read our Privacy notice Xabi Alonso has confirmed he will leave Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season. The Spaniard led German outfit to a famous league and cup double across a remarkable unbeaten domestic season last year. But after coming up short in his attempt to retain the Bundesliga title, Alonso confirmed his decision to depart ahead of Sunday’s home clash with Borussia Dortmund, ending a three-year spell at the club. ""This week, the club and I have agreed that these last two games are going to be my last as Leverkusen coach,"" Alonso said. ""Now is the right moment to announce it. ""We want to have a proper farewell on Sunday. This morning I have talked with players and staff. For sure it is a moment with mixed emotions. ""I have to be thankful for everyone - from the fans, the people in the club and for sure the players. We can be happy and we can be proud of what we have achieved. We are taking the club in the right direction."" Alonso is set to take over from Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid manager, reuniting with the club he spent five successful years at - winning La Liga in 2012 before helping the Galacticos to Champions League glory over city rivals Atletico in 2014. The 43-year-old was one game away from securing a historic treble last season as he looked to add a Europa League to his Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal titles - only to be thwarted by an Ademola Lookman hat-trick in Dublin as Atalanta came out 3-0 final victors. Nevertheless, Alonso accomplished an incredible turnaround at the BayArena, with his appointment in October 2022 coming when Leverkusen sat in the relegation zone of the Bundesliga after their worst start to a season since 1979. After propelling them up the table in his debut season to earn European qualification, Alonso then embarked on a 35-game Bundesliga unbeaten streak to win Bayer Leverkusen a first ever top-flight title. The Spaniard was strongly linked with a return to former club Liverpool last summer, but opted to stay put in Germany for what would be one more season. He will now leave the club after the last game of the season at Mainz, with a move to the Bernabeu beckoning.

Salah won his first Footballer of the Year award in his first season at Liverpool in 2017-18 and won it again in 2021-22. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson picked up the prize in 2019-20, the season the Reds won their first title in 30 years. Henry won the award three times in four years between 2002-03 and 2005-06. In the last 30 years, Cristiano Ronaldo is the only other Premier League player to have won the award on multiple occasions. Salah is also the favourite to win the Premier League Player of the Season and Players’ Player of the Year awards.

Independent,Sports,IPL season suspended for one week amid India-Pakistan conflict,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-ipl-suspended-pakistan-b2747783.html,"A decision has reportedly been made following the abandonment of Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday following rising tensions between the country and Pakistan I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been suspended by the Indian cricket board following rising tensions between the country and Pakistan, a source with direct knowledge of the situation has told Reuters. Thursday's IPL match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in the hill city of Dharamsala was abandoned midway amid fighting on the border regions, though the cricket board maintained the decision was due to a power failure at the stadium. The decision left the immediate future for the money-spinning T20 tournament in doubt, though IPL chairman Arun Singh Dhumal and the Indian cricket board's secretary Devajit Saikia did not respond to Reuters calls. The world's richest cricket tournament began its current season on March 22, and the final fixture was scheduled to be played on May 25, with matches being spread over 13 venues across the country. The nuclear-armed neighbours have been locked in conflict since Wednesday, when India targeted multiple locations in Pakistan, claiming they were ""terrorist infrastructure"" in response to a deadly attack in Kashmir last month. New Delhi named two Pakistani nationals as suspects and accused Islamabad of being involved in the attack, a charge Pakistan denied and sought an independent probe. India's army said Pakistan's armed forces carried out ""multiple attacks"" using drones and other munitions across the entire western border on Thursday night and early Friday, a claim Pakistan denied. Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals were both awarded one point after the decision to abandon the match, with rain and a wet outfield initially delaying the start by an 90 minutes. “Due to a power outage in the area, one of the light towers at the HPCA stadium malfunctioned,"" the IPL said in a statement. ""BCCI regrets the inconvenience caused to the in-stadium attendees.” It was the final game of the season in Dharamsala, with the IPL shifting Punjab’s scheduled game on Sunday against Mumbai Indians to Ahmedabad over the India-Pakistan tensions. Airports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh, where the Punjab Kings are based, have been closed for civilian and commercial purposes since Wednesday, with more airports in India’s northwestern corridor also closed off.
