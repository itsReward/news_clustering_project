Independent,Business,BlackRock’s billions show it’s not all gloom for UK business,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/stock-markets-blackrock-interest-rates-uk-b2739490.html,"Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism, as Karl Matchett reports I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The mood around UK business has ranged from cautious to desperate in the past few months as the economy battles inflation, tax grabs, rising labour costs and the prospects of US tariffs. Add in constant political pressures giving a bleak outlook and the stock market plummeting in early April on the back of those tariffs, and UK plc could be forgiven for thinking 2025 might become a year to forget. But perhaps all is not as bad as it was beginning to appear, with some important signs giving relief and optimism to some businesses who got a share price backing boost thanks to the world’s biggest investor, BlackRock, building stakes in multiple companies. And the most imminent boost will be a cut to interest rates. The Bank of England meets on 8 May and a 0.25 per cent cut appears all but guaranteed at this stage. And back-to-back rates cuts are entirely possible, bringing the Bank Rate down to 4 per cent by summer. It would be the first time since March 2023 that the interest rate returns to that level, easing costs for business owners with debt and perhaps allowing more consideration to investment on projects and other spending which could spark opportunities for the growth the economy desperately needs. Some businesses already look well-positioned to capture that growth, believes Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock. “[The company has] allocated more capital back to the UK tactically now with the belief that in the short run, the new administration is trying to tackle some of the hard issues,” Mr Fink toldThe Times. “I think the prime minister is articulating the needs of what we have to do. I have more confidence in the UK economy today than I did a year ago.” Pointing to some of the financial institutions that had seen their share price hammered this year as the FTSE 100 dropped along with other major stock markets, Mr Fink explained how BlackRock had taken stakes in different sectors in the belief the selloff was overdone. “So many of the UK stocks discounts were too deep, especially like in the banking system. Look at the rebound in the valuations of NatWest and Lloyds and how they bounced. We added to our positions across the board with the idea that we believe the market was discounting too much negativity. And we believe the negativity was probably not warranted,” he said. Having seen a significant drop from 3 April onwards, the FTSE 100 - the biggest firms on the London Stock Exchange - have bounced back somewhat and now remain up more than two per cent since the start of 2025, even if they have collectively not reached March’s high points. Interest rate drops - while affecting households in terms of mortgages, savings accounts and so on - also impact investing. That is in part due to lower guaranteed returns from cash or like-cash holdings, meaning more risk may be taken on in the form of stock market equities. Rising share prices help improve investor and business confidence, while consumers may then benefit from having more money in their own pockets if rate drops mean they pay less on mortgages and other debt. There are further positives in other sectors. Retail sales rose almost half a percent in the UK during March, and that came ahead of April when the rise to minimum wage kicked in meaning more money in some workers’ pockets. Jacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said: “Glimpses of warmer weather and improving consumer confidence meant retail sales continued its upward trend in March. Sales volumes rose for the third consecutive month, reaching their highest level since July 2022. The first quarter of 2025 suggests consumer spending is slowly starting to return, which should provide some reason for optimism in the retail sector.” Then there’s analysis from Barclays, showing both wage growth easing and contraction in employment. Both of these factors will further ease pressure on the Bank of England when it comes to deciding rates cuts. Small wins they might seem, and with little impact of individuals, but as we so often see in businesses, it’s those small wins adding up continuously which lead to the potential to outperform. Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism.

Independent,Business,Why Tesla’s fall forced Musk to step back from DOGE,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/tesla-elon-musk-doge-profits-share-price-stock-b2737802.html,"A 71 per cent drop in profits and tanking share price have forced Elon Musk to cut down his time as Trump’s costcutter-in-chief. Alicja Hagopian and Karl Matchett explore what happened I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice At the start of the year, Tesla’s share price was at an all-time high. Elon Musk, owner of the electric vehicle giant, was coasting on the win of his ally Donald Trump, and investors were hedging their bets that soon-to-be-President Trump would enact policies in favour of Tesla and the billionaire’s other companies. But with an astronomical fall in share price, tanking sales and shrinking profits, the reality for Tesla has been far different – and much of it is tied to Musk’s public-facing role in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla stock once made up the majority of Musk’s wealth, but now it is reporting huge drops in profit. The decision to step away from DOGE may show that Musk is not immune to Tesla’s downfall. Within one month of Musk’s appointment to DOGE, Tesla shares were down 16.5 per cent. Within two, Tesla’s share price was down 45 per cent from when Trump came into office. And Musk himself has lost an estimated $149 billion in wealth since taking the helm at DOGE; at $301 billion compared to $449 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Tesla’s share price problems have been far from cosmetic. The business is facing significant headwinds, not least because of the intertwined reputation with its notorious leader. In January and February, Tesla sales in Europe saw sudden dips, of 45 per cent and 39 per cent respectively year-on-year - despite steady growth in the European electric vehicle (EV) market. The numbers behind this week’s latest earnings reports are, as expected, not pretty. Quarterly profits of $409m contrasted starkly with last year’s $1.4bn figure for the same three months - and the 71 per cent drop represents the company’s lowest quarterly profits since 2020. Actual vehicle sales reported this month were down 13 per cent to a little over a third of a million across the January to March quarter, with notable declines in China and parts of the US, while revenue of $19.3bn fell short of forecasts by more than $2bn and operating margins fell to 2.1 per cent. “Earnings margin of 2.1 per cent is the lowest since Tesla approached break-even in 2019,” said Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “Free cash flow dipped to $660 million, but did not enter negative territory as capital expenditures were nearly halved compared to the prior year due to reduced investments. “Tesla has [also] effectively removed its growth guidance for this year, no longer promising a return to growth in 2025.” Additional factors affecting sales include competition from China’s BYD (Build Your Dreams), which undercuts Tesla on price, while frequent recalls of Tesla vehicles may also be doing little to boost confidence in the brand. But it is impossible to ignore a major factor impacting its brand: Musk’s growing unpopularity. Musk has made no secret of his increasingly controversial political viewpoints. From accusations of a nazi salute at the inauguration, to criticising Volodmyr Zelensky as “evil” over the war in Ukraine, it is easy to see how his actions have ruffled feathers. As a result, a string of attacks have targeted Teslas in Europe and the US over the past few months, with clear anti-Musk messages. Tesla owners have faced threats to sell their cars over “Nazi Extremism” in California, while even in the UK, campaign groups have applied pressure against Tesla cars and charging points. Tesla shareholders are pushing back against Musk’s alignment with Trump; his decision to step partly away from DOGE indicates Musk is likely feeling the blowback himself. Investors may have hoped that Musk’s role in the administration would see carveouts for Tesla in Trump’s trade war. But in fact, the electric vehicle brand is far from immune. Tesla manufactures its electric vehicles in the US, which makes it less exposed to 25 per cent automotive tariffs than foreign brands. But the tariffs are not just on finished cars; there is also a 25 per cent levy on all imported automotive parts, and Tesla relies on many parts imported from China, in addition to Mexico and Canada: the company is dependent on imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to fuel its EVs, in particular using Chinese manufacturer CATL to supply its factories. And China’s new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets have also impacted other projects from Tesla such as its Optimus humanoid robots. With Tesla dependent on batteries and rare earth products from China, the trade war will inevitably hit its supply chain. Following Tesla’s plummeting profits, it might have been expected that the share price could drop further - but the opposite has happened. On Tuesday, the share price had risen 4.6 per cent; following the announcement of Mr Musk’s intentions to resume greater oversight of corporate rather than Capitol Hill activities, that trajectory continued. Tesla shares are up more than seven per cent in pre-trading, set to open well above $250 per share - still a far cry from December’s peak. Lowered expectations can explain part of it, as well as a broader desire from investors to see a bull run resume - from lower share price starting points. “Tesla’s first-quarter delivery and production numbers were as ugly as its Cybertruck design. That meant expectations were rock-bottom in the run-up to its financial results and it’s why the shares didn’t tank upon release of the Q1 earnings,” noted Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. “Certain individuals are spotting an opportunity and might take the view that Tesla’s significant share price decline has gone too far - they’re buying on the dip, hoping for a bounce-back and might view the recent sell-off as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pick up shares in a previous stock market darling on the cheap. After all, the fundamentals still give bulls something to get excited about.” Not everyone is quite as excited about those humanoid robots, self-driving taxis and energy storage products though. “While Tesla is making progress on these initiatives, we believe the market and management commentary are overly optimistic about the timing. The narrative around Tesla’s stock and valuation remains heavily dependent on these future prospects,” Valechha cautioned. It should also be noted, the uptick isn’t totally down to Tesla, Musk or anything to do with electrification - Trump’s China tariff climbdown has sent the S&P 500 two per cent higher in pre-trading, with the likes of Amazon and Nvidia up four per cent each. Market volatility comes as standard in this second Trump term, and for Tesla which inadvertently became a crossover company to the political arena, that continues to go double.

Independent,Business,Bank cuts interest rates to 4.25% as tariff tensions dampen growth,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/bank-cuts-interest-rates-to-4-25-as-tariff-tensions-dampen-growth-b2747167.html,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The Bank of England has cut interest rates to its lowest level for two years as it warned an escalating global trade war will drag on growth over the next three years. The central bank cut the UK’s base interest rate from 4.5% to 4.25% following a slowdown in inflation in recent months. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said: “Inflationary pressures have continued to ease so we’ve been able to cut rates again today.” Five members of the Bank’s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee voted for the 0.25 percentage point cut. Two members voted to hold rates at 4.5%, while a further two called for a sharp cut to 4%. The Bank also predicted the UK economy will grow by 1% this year, upgrading its previous 0.75% forecast on the back of a strong start to 2025. However, on Thursday it cut its UK growth forecast to 1.25% for 2026, from 1.5% in its February projections. It said recently announced US tariff plans and their impact on global trade will dent UK growth by 0.3 percentage points over the next three years. Most of this impact is set to come from “lower US demand for UK exports” and weaker global activity, according to the Bank’s latest report. It added that increased “uncertainty” over the trade policy is also likely to contribute to the downward impact on UK growth. The forecasts were based on tariff policy from the end of April, factoring in a 10% US tariff rate on most UK exports to the country, as well as a 25% tariff on cars and steel. However, the predictions come hours ahead of an announcement from President Donald Trump which is widely expected to unveil a trade deal between the UK and US. Meanwhile, UK inflation is predicted to witness a shallower rise than previously expected. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is on track to peak at 3.5% in the third quarter of this year, on the back of rising energy prices. However, this is a reduction on its previous guidance that inflation would peak at 3.7%. Inflation is also due to come back down to the 2% target rate set by the Government and Bank of England by the first quarter of 2027, ahead of its previous forecast. Nevertheless, Bank officials signalled higher trade tariffs are likely to push UK inflation down by “0.2 percentage points in two years’ time”. Weaker global trade activity and reduced US demand for exports are expected to contribute to the drop in inflation, according to the report. It also highlighted however multinational firms could change their pricing in the UK in order to help deal with the impact of “higher costs in other jurisdictions”. The Bank has also predicted it will cut interest rates at a faster rate than previously expected, amid the backdrop of potentially shallower inflation and slower growth next year. It has said interest rates are predicted to fall as low as 3.5% by the second quarter of next year, indicating a further three cuts by rate-setters. Meanwhile, UK unemployment is also predicted to rise over the next two years, as businesses face uncertainty over trade tensions and the recent increase in wages and national insurance contributions. The unemployment rate is set to peak at 5% next year and stay at this level in 2027, according to the new forecasts. The Bank previously predicted it would rise to a high of 4.8%.",2025-05-08
Independent,Business,Bank of England cuts interest rates for second time this year,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/interest-rates-bank-of-england-mortgages-b2743797.html,"Following cuts in February and now May, the base rate is down from a high of 5.25 per cent to a level last seen two years ago in May 2023 I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The Bank of England has confirmed a 25 basis points cut to the Bank Rate down to 4.25 per cent, a second such drop this year in an ongoing boost to businesses and mortgage payers alike. Following cuts in February and now May, the base rate is down from a high of 5.25 per cent to a level last seen two years ago in May 2023. While the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had been widely expected to bring interest rate down this time, there is a wider possibility for back-to-back rate cuts - while some analysts predict a further three cuts to happen this year, bringing the interest rate down below four per cent for the first time since January 2023. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said: ""Inflationary pressures have continued to ease so we've been able to cut rates again today."" The Bank also predicted that the UK economy will grow by 1 per cent this year, upgrading its previous 0.75 per cent forecast on the back of a strong start to 2025. However, it added that recently announced US tariff plans and their impact on global trade will dent UK growth by 0.3 percentage points over the next three years, as it downgraded its 2026 forecast. Most of this downward impact is to come from ""lower US demand for UK exports"" and weaker global activity, according to the Bank's latest report. Nathan Emerson, chief executive of Propertymark, said: ""Today's news will no doubt be extremely welcome for many, especially given current economic uncertainties. International bodies have recently stated they expect interest rates to fall in the UK as the year progresses. Overall, we hope to see interest rates further continue their downward trajectory over the course of 2025. ""The UK housing market has recently been buoyed by Stamp Duty threshold changes leading up to the start of April, and with the busier spring and summer months now here, this base rate reduction should attract even more buyers and sellers to the market and provide greater affordability. ""Housing is a central part of the UK economy, and we now hope to see considering the UK Government and the devolved administrations have shown a keen focus on housing growth, is that they look ahead to achieving their individual housebuilding targets to meet growing demand."" Businesses habitually look to invest more money in projects or personnel when interest rates are lower, as the cost of taking on debt is in turn lower. Theo Chatha, CFO of Bibby Financial Services, pointed out that more than six in ten smaller businesses (62 per cent) have said they’d “feel more confident investing” with lower rates - but cautioned against potential future interest rate rises if the UK faces inflationary pressures as a result of Trump tariffs. “The Bank may need to raise rates again later in the year to curb inflation due to tariffs friction,” he said. “This threatens to dampen SMEs’ ambition – meaning investment plans are delayed further, but SMEs can’t afford a ‘wait and see’ approach to decision making. Against economic uncertainty, businesses that continue to invest and plan for every scenario will stay ahead of the competition.” While this interest rate cut was already largely priced into mortgage markets, the possibility of future interest rate cuts should still see more competitive product rates emerging in the months ahead. Plenty of lenders are already fighting a sub-four per cent battle, a relief to any of those homeowners set to come to the end of a fixed term across the coming months. On the other hand, while loans will also become cheaper to pay off if not linked to fixed interest rates, any cash held in variable rate savings accounts could soon be earning less.

Independent,Politics,Donald Trump expected to announce ‘major trade deal’ with UK,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/us-uk-trade-deal-trump-starmer-announcement-b2746984.html,"It would mark the first deal agreed upon since Mr Trump’s ‘liberation day’ announcement of global tariffs last month I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The UK and US are expected to agree a deal to reduce tariffs on Thursday after Donald Trump promised a “major trade deal” with a “highly respected country”. A month after the US president’s so-called liberation day tariffs came into effect, British negotiators are in Washington and are believed to have finalised a carve-out for the UK. In a coup for Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Trump is expected to unveil the agreement at an Oval Office press conference on Thursday. Speaking on Thursday, Sir Keir said: “As you know talks with the us have been ongoing and you will hear more from me about that later “But make no mistake, I will always act in our national interest for workers, businesses and families to deliver security and renewal for our country. “Because the world has changed, decisively.” Mr Trump took to his Truth Social platform to announce he would hold a news conference at 10am local time (3pm BST) about a “major trade deal with representatives of a big, and highly respected, country”. The government has been pursuing a deal with the US to reduce the impact of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr Trump last month, which placed a 10 per cent levy on all UK exports and a 25 per cent charge on steel, aluminium and cars. Reports have previously suggested a deal could see the UK reduce some tariffs on US products, as well as change the digital services tax that currently affects mainly US tech companies. But the government has ruled out lowering food standards to allow more US agricultural products into the country, or watering down the Online Safety Act, which some in the US regard as placing restrictions on freedom of speech. It would mark the first deal agreed upon since Mr Trump’s sweeping tariffs last month wreaked havoc on global markets and put the UK’s public finances in jeopardy. The deal would be a vindication of Sir Keir’s approach to the US president, having been reluctant to criticise Mr Trump and senior members of his administration. As Labour reels from a bruising set of local election results, it is also a fresh boost for the prime minister, coming hot on the heels of a major agreement struck with India on Tuesday. The US and UK have been holding talks over a potential trade deal, with chancellor Rachel Reeves saying the government has been working “flat out” to secure an agreement that would mitigate the impact of the tariffs. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College London, told The Independent the trade deal would be “damage limitation rather than an economic boost”. “That is, it is likely to limit the Trump tariffs, but our exporters will probably still be facing higher tariffs overall than they were last year,” he said. Professor Portes added: “This will clearly be a relief to companies and the government deserves credit, but Trump’s policies overall remain a huge downside to the global economy and hence to the UK.” The defence secretary declined to comment on reports that a US-UK trade deal would be announced on Thursday. John Healey told Times Radio: ""It's certainly true that the US is an indispensable ally for the UK, both on economic and national security grounds. ""It's also true that since the prime minister visited the White House in February we have been in detailed talks about an economic deal. ""But I have to say, throughout that period, ministers like me have been keen to give the negotiations the space to get the best possible deal for the UK. ""So, we just haven't been giving a running commentary on developments or timelines, so I'm not going to start now."" The Liberal Democrats called for parliament to be given a vote on any US trade agreement, with a warning it could “undermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires”. Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Daisy Cooper said: “A good trade deal with the US could bring huge benefits, but Liberal Democrats are deeply concerned that it may include measures that threaten our NHS, undermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires. “If the government is confident the agreement it has negotiated with Trump is in Britain’s national interest, it should not be afraid to bring it before MPs.” The UK announced it had come to terms on a trade deal with India on Tuesday, which will mean dramatic tariff reductions on scotch whisky and car exports to the country. Levies on aerospace, electricals and other food products will also fall under the agreement, while UK consumers are expected to benefit from tariffs being reduced on some Indian goods such as clothing imported to the country. Announcing the deal, prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said: “We are now in a new era for trade and the economy. That means going further and faster to strengthen the UK’s economy, putting more money in working people’s pockets.” He added: “Today we have agreed a landmark deal with India – one of the fastest growing economies in the world, which will grow the economy and deliver for British people and business.” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi described it as a “historic milestone” and an “ambitious and mutually beneficial” trade agreement that will “catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies”.

Independent,Politics,Digitising NHS and adult social care ‘will cost £21bn over the next five years’,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-health-foundation-government-england-department-of-health-and-social-care-b2746961.html,"I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Digitising NHS and social care will cost £21 billion over the next five years, but could be vital for driving down waiting lists, according to new research. A report said the UK will need to spend billions to fully implement electronic patient records, cloud storage, cyber security and wi-fi, with the skills and capabilities needed to use them. The Health Foundation charity commissioned PA Consulting ahead of the forthcoming Government spending review, and publication of the 10-year health plan, to estimate the costs of making the transformation to digital services. The Government has pledged to move the health service from analogue to digital as part of its “three shifts” for the NHS, which also include moving care from hospitals to communities and preventing sickness. In the new report, estimates suggest that £8 billion of capital spending (of which £5 billion is for England) is needed for things like hardware, software and electronic patient records. A further £3 billion would be one-off revenue spending (of which £2.25 billion is for England), for planning, initial education and training, implementation of new technologies and transition from old systems. Some £2 billion recurring annual spending (of which £1.5 billion per year is for England) over five years is also needed for ongoing training, software subscriptions, maintenance, improvement and optimisation. Recurring costs will then carry on beyond the five-year period. According to the Health Foundation, while it may be possible to cover some of the costs from existing budgets, it is highly likely the Government will need to commit additional funding. Tom Hardie, senior improvement fellow at the Health Foundation, said: “Digitisation is going to be really critical for the NHS and social care to be sustainable and fit for the 21st century. “When we talk about waiting times in particular, I think there are hopes that digitisation could help to address waiting times. “Within this research, we haven’t set out to define or quantify the benefits of digitisation, but I think it’s possible to say that digitisation could theoretically help to reduce waiting times. “So, for example, making it easier and simpler for people to get appointments or to cancel and rebook appointments. “It could help to optimise (operating) theatre schedules, improve prevention of acute episodes of care through remote monitoring of people with health conditions, improved triage processes to help direct people to the right services first time (and) perhaps avoiding more resource-intensive services like A&E.” Making the NHS more digitally capable will also free up staff time, he said. Figures suggest that medics lose more than 13.5 million hours a year because of inadequate or malfunctioning IT. Dr Malte Gerhold, director of innovation and improvement at the Health Foundation, said: “Our independently commissioned research finds that to achieve the Government’s ambitions to digitise health and social care, significant spending will be needed over the next five years and beyond. “But direct investment in technology alone is not sufficient. “The Government must fund the change not just the tech. This means investing in and planning for implementation and change to genuinely realise the benefits of digitisation for patients and staff.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the private sector is 15 years ahead of the NHS on technology, adding: “This Government is bringing our analogue NHS into the digital age, to improve the productivity of the NHS, deliver better care for patients and better value for taxpayers. “We are already making significant progress by introducing cutting-edge AI and technology to support clinicians and improve care, reforming the NHS app to give patients more control, and centralising patient records to speed up diagnosis and treatment. “This is only possible because of the increase in employers’ national insurance, which allowed us to invest an extra £26 billion for health and social care.”",2025-05-08

Exporters have been lobbying ministers hard over the impact of the tariffs, which forced Jaguar Land Rover to suspend exports to the US last month. Britain’s beleaguered steel industry has also warned the US president’s tariffs pose further challenges for the sector. “They couldn’t come at a worse time,” Gareth Stace, director general of the UK Steel trade association said when they came into force. Around 5 per cent of UK steel exports and 6 per cent of aluminium exports go to the US, according to the government. While Britain hopes for an exemption from the higher 25 per cent tariffs, the trade deal is unlikely to see Mr Trump’s baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports lifted for the UK. One of the biggest goals of US negotiators has been to win concessions on Britain’s digital services tax (DST), paid by overseas search engines and social media sites on revenues from the UK. It would be a boost to major American firms such as Amazon, Facebook owner Meta and Google owner Alphabet. One mooted change would be to lower the headline rate paid by the US tech giants, while at the same time applying it to companies from other countries to make up the shortfall. It would mean no tax income would be lost from the levy overall, with the DST currently raising £800m a year. The government has also reportedly offered to lower tariffs on American chicken, beef and other meats, in a move which could further inflame tensions between Labour and farmers. A consistent red line in negotiations has been food standards, amid fears a trade deal could open Britain’s doors to hormone-injected beef and chlorinated chicken. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and the chancellor have both ruled out lowering Britain's food standards to get a deal over the line, in a boost to struggling farmers. Industries who will be watching Mr Trump’s Oval Office announcement closely on Thursday include the film and TV industry and pharmaceutical industry. Mr Trump has threatened to levy 100 per cent tariffs on films made outside America, which the PM has been warned would devastate film and TV production in the UK. British officials have been locked in talks with US counterparts since Mr Trump outlined the plans, with a view to exempting Britain from the levies. Officials have also been desperately trying to exempt British firms from a fresh threatened 25 per cent tariff on pharmaceuticals produced abroad. The measure would have a huge impact on UK giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, and negotiators are racing to find a carve out. The key point to remember is that Thursday’s trade deal is not the long sought after post-Brexit trade deal with the US, chased by successive prime ministers. The deal is likely to have a narrower focus than the wide-ranging agreement struck with India on Tuesday. Talks are likely to continue about a more ambitious agreement in the long run, but Thursday’s deal is expected to ease the immediate pressure of Mr Trump’s trade war.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,How MobLand completely ruined the UK’s favourite swear word,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/mobland-swearing-guy-ritchie-pierce-brosnan-b2745698.html,"The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Profanity has always been the heart and soul of Guy Ritchie’s tough guy offerings, but his new Paramount show is saturated in so many c-words that it may just have ushered in the death of swearing. Helen Coffey mourns the senseless dilution of our most beloved curse word I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice When I started watching MobLand, Guy Ritchie’s new London gangster drama featuring an all-star cast including Dame Helen Mirren, Tom Hardy and Pierce Brosnan, I initially thought the most ridiculous thing in it was the accents. There’s Brosnan’s preposterous “Irish” brogue for starters – even more inexplicable when you consider that the man actually is Irish – an amalgamation of every terrible “top o’ the mornin’ to ya!” impression you’ve ever heard, and arguably even worse than his much-mocked turn in the 1988 film Taffin. Then there’s Mirren’s equally scattergun attempt at convincing us she hails from the Emerald Isle, not to mention the myriad botched cockney dialects that frequently threaten to tip over into full Dick Van Dyke territory. But before long, another element in the buzzy new Paramount show, centred around the Harrigan crime family, vied for top dog in the “suspend your disbelief” Olympics. The first time it happened was nine minutes and 45 seconds into episode one: the c-word, flung out in a gritty East End nightclub, the mobster equivalent of a glove slap as the precursor to a duel. Another one landed five seconds later. A third swiftly followed. A brief spell of furious running from Eddie Harrigan (Anson Boon), and then “c***” number four slid into view. At first, I took it in my stride. These are professional criminals, I reasoned; a little potty-mouthed dialogue is par for the course when you’ve got a load of hardmen trying to out-hard each other while strutting around and flashing weaponry. Yet the repetition quickly became so frequent it began to feel a little… farcical. Silly, even. The word resembled an arbitrary punctuation mark, a kind of lazy shorthand for “Look at us – we’re ever so tough!” Without even realising I was doing it, I stopped paying attention to the story and switched my focus to counting the “c***s”. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine… They stopped just shy of double digits in episode one, but I was on a roll now. I continued tallying with a kind of horrified fascination, as if doing an 18-rated version of Count von Count from Sesame Street’s schtick. Episode two saw a dip in usage, with only two during the entire 50-minute runtime, but by episode three we were back, baby: another nine, shoehorned in with all the subtlety of a brick lobbed through a freshly glazed window. The undisputed winner, though, was episode five, the “c***”s coming thick and fast to reach a dizzying total of 11 – the equivalent of one every three minutes. Five of these were uttered in the final eight minutes alone. The word is used indiscriminately by nearly every character in the show, upon any and every occasion. Feeling lethally angry towards someone? Call them a c***. Mildly aggrieved? Call them a c***. Affectionate? Call them a c***. Sorry for them? Call them a poor c***. It would make an effective drinking game – take a shot every time you hear the c-word! – but only if your real aim was to end the evening in A&E getting your stomach pumped. It’s like someone fed Peter Cook and Dudley Moore’s infamous Derek and Clive Live “This Bloke Came Up To Me” sketch – which contains an awe-inspiring 36 “c***”s within the space of three minutes and 40 seconds – into ChatGPT and asked it to burp out a 10-part gangster drama. By the time I’d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word, let alone the most potent one in the English language. I had to catch myself before saying it casually to my mum on the phone; my boss over Slack; the unsuspecting woman on the checkout at Asda. I had to remind myself that calling someone a “c***” is not, in fact, an appropriate response to every situation. Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 day New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

The c-word has long been the undisputed king of swears, one that wields the mightiest power to offend, titillate and make people laugh depending on timing and context. The oldest word for female genitalia in the English language, this is profanity with some historical clout (though, admittedly, it wasn’t offensive back in the 13th century when its first usage was recorded). It may be too much for many Americans’ tastes, and have been watered down into a neutral or complimentary term by the Aussies (see: “He’s a good c***”), but most Brits hold the expletive in high esteem, understanding its expansive, unrivalled capacity to shock and endear. It’s no coincidence that The White Lotus’s English stars, Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood, both independently named it as their favourite curse word in recent interviews. By the time I’d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word Understand when and where to use it – shrewdly and with discernment – and it’s like carrying the sharpest, most adaptable blade in your lexiconic arsenal at all times. National treasure Kathy Burke is the master of this, able to deftly deploy “c***” with the precision and comedic timing it needs to hit a home run. By comparison, MobLand isn’t even attempting to make contact with the ball – simply lobbing bats across the field at random and hoping one of them hits something. I’m not annoyed by the proliferation of profanity because I’m offended by it. I’m annoyed because MobLand has taken this most special of curses, in all its jagged, ugly elegance, and flogged it to death, diluting it through overexposure and robbing it of its muscle. The sheer abundance of “c***”s ensures they don’t punch through or enhance the dialogue. Instead, they awkwardly stumble across the screen: flabby, toothless, a little embarrassing. It’s like seeing a once-proud empress dethroned and wandering the streets in rags. My heart aches for her. It’s ironic, in a way. In a drama dominated by senseless gangland killings, the murder of our beloved c-word turned out to be the most tragic of all.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,A 10 Things I Hate About You reboot without Heath Ledger is insanity,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/10-things-i-hate-about-you-reboot-heath-ledger-b2746364.html,"The director behind the 1999 teen classic has announced three sequels are in development, though sans the original’s biggest star Heath Ledger, who died in 2008. And it’s news that wildly misunderstands the appeal of the original, argues Adam White I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You remains one of the key definitions of a “star is born” performance. Tall, handsome, with blush-worthy levels of camera-ready magnetism, Ledger sauntered into pop-culture consciousness in 1999 as a chain-smoking (rumoured) bad boy teen paid to take an arty cool girl (the similarly luminous Julia Stiles) to prom. Allowed to retain his Aussie accent, Ledger is ludicrously charismatic in the film, all lackadaisical flirtation and alluring ambivalence. Can you even imagine 10 Things… without him? Well, imagine no more: a Heath-less reboot is in development. Is nothing sacred etc...? Despite celebrity deaths typically halting unasked-for revivals in their tracks (remember how close we got to a second Mrs Doubtfire in the months before Robin Williams’s death in 2014?), a trilogy of sequels to 10 Things I Hate About You is coming down the pipe. The original film’s director Gil Junger has confirmed that each new movie will explore different stages of adult life, which will be reflected in their respective titles: 10 Things I Hate About Dating; 10 Things I Hate About Marriage; and 10 Things I Hate About Kids. How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways. Junger said that he is open to cast members from the first film returning for “cameos” or “small parts”, mentioning Larry Miller by name – the actor who played father to Stiles’s moody wallflower. Absent, though, obviously, would be Ledger, who died in 2008 at the depressingly young age of 28. But don’t worry, Junger told People Magazine, it’d be “a beautiful idea” to somehow nod to Ledger in the new movies, adding: “He deserves to be loved.” Sure! But isn’t there something particularly grim about this, even for an age in which absolutely every bit of pre-existing intellectual property (IP) – The Bodyguard (maybe) with Taylor Swift! Single White Female with Jenna Ortega! Legally Blonde without Reese Witherspoon! – is being strip-mined for parts? 10 Things wasn’t a film led by its premise, which more or less mirrored the conventions of every other major teen movie in 1999: finding love through deception, prom night entanglements, enemies to lovers, Shakespeare-aping silliness (as any GCSE English student will tell you, its plot was inspired by The Taming of the Shrew). What made it a generational classic was Ledger and Stiles, two preternaturally gifted young actors with intelligence and wit in spades, along with the particularly skilled cast that surrounded them (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gabrielle Union and David Krumholtz). And it was also down to the unusually thoughtful, character-driven script by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith, who made sure that Stiles’s moody Kat Stratford was never shamed for being a snarky, alternative bookworm, or transformed – She’s All That-style – into something more aggressively conventional. McCullah and Smith are, at this point, not involved in the revival, suggesting this is very much a Gil Junger project. And you can hardly blame his eagerness. Junger, whose last significant movie was 2001’s Martin Lawrence medieval romp Black Knight, has been attempting to mount 10 Things reboots since 2009, first with a short-lived TV series inspired by the film (you probably don’t remember it either), then in 2012 with the film sequel 10 Things I Hate About Life starring Evan Rachel Wood. If that’s inspired you to say “huh?”, it’s because it never got finished – production was cancelled two months into filming. I understand the impulse for a filmmaker to try and further monetise his biggest hit, but 10 Things I Hate About You isn’t an incredibly flexible bit of IP that can exist as little more than a brand name. It is specific and singular, something only crystallised by the death of its biggest name. I also can’t see anyone being particularly interested in it, either. Without Ledger, there won’t even be the slim pleasure of watching old castmates reuniting (which seems to be the sole impetus behind the forthcoming Freakier Friday with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan). It’ll just be the most currently unemployed cast members from a perfect film from 25 years ago, vainly attempting to resurrect its magic – and what a miserable idea that is.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Natasha Lyonne’s big-hearted mystery show Poker Face is a TV anomaly,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/poker-face-season-2-sky-natasha-lyonne-review-b2746955.html,"The comedy drama returns with more irreverent fun and a very human sense of chaos and jeopardy I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The vintage Plymouth Barracuda rolls on. Fittingly, it’s slightly tatty but it has a vibe all of its own. As we rejoin Natasha Lyonne’s hyper-charismatic human lie detector Charlie Cale, for a second season of what a narrative theorist would call inverted detective stories and we might think of as “howcatchems”, she’s still racing across America. She has a casino owner and an organised crime gang on her tail (initially, at least, they seem both spectacularly dimwitted and are terribly poor shots), but as if that wasn’t enough to cope with, she still can’t stop running into murder mysteries and she still can’t help solving them. Somehow though, she still seems to be having fun. And therefore, so are we. Poker Face (Sky Max) is, in current TV terms, something of an anomaly. Created by Knives Out director Rian Johnson, it proudly sets its stall out to entertain – which often doesn’t feel like a given in the context of the labyrinthine longueurs of much streaming-era television. On the face of it, it’s a simple show; a “case of the week” throwback. While certain dramas wear narrative complexity like a badge of honour, Poker Face is as brisk, no-nonsense and free of airs and graces as the lead character herself. Like the shows it most obviously recalls (it’s impossible not to mention Columbo at this point), it’s deeply contrived. But the contrivances are a big part of the fun – sometimes they subvert conventions, sometimes they wink gleefully at them. Clues fall conveniently into Charlie’s lap and, for some reason, it works. Often, during her reveals, she’ll pace the room; a woman performing Peter Falk karaoke and inviting viewers to laugh fondly along with her. And yet Poker Face never tips over into self-indulgence – alongside its style and wit, it carries real emotional weight too. This is almost entirely down to Lyonne, whose wry, weary resilience sustains the show. “Introspection makes me queasy,” says Charlie. And it’s easy to imagine why – Charlie doesn’t understand her own gift for sniffing out bull**** and nor does she particularly welcome it. Instead, these situations find her as she ricochets from town to town and job to job; taking on temporary work that ranges from fruit picking to Halloween zombie enactment. With kind eyes and a voice like sandpaper, she elicits confidences from almost everyone she meets. And that’s really her problem: she’s incapable of ignoring people and even less able to avoid empathising. Across this second series, her inner life and backstory start to manifest themselves, even if she’d rather they didn’t. In the meantime, she revels in what she describes, somewhat self-mockingly, as “the unobserved pageant of the ordinary”. The individual cases themselves are beautifully realised and this is key to the show’s consistency. At their best, and like the finest literary short stories, they offer brief but total immersion in a fully imagined world. Take the series opener, featuring a bravura performance from Cynthia Erivo, who plays five parts, often simultaneously. Amber (Erivo) and her quadruplet sisters (Erivo) were child actors – the rotating stars of cheesy but beloved TV show Kid Cop. They were cheated of their rightful fortunes by their scheming mother who is about to die. Amber, who has devoted her life to caring for this cruel, selfish woman, decides she deserves the bulk of the inheritance. But how far might she be prepared to go to get it? With the episode’s head-spinning identity swaps and layers of multiplying subterfuge, it is, in what feels like a deliberate nod to Lyonne’s breakthrough lead show, a true Russian doll of a storyline. And so it goes on. Charlie quits town again, heading to a funeral home, then a school talent show, then an alligator farm. And what initially feels like repetition soon begins to feel like a deepening of intention. It’s lightly carried and never clumsily forced but even so, there’s a fairly serious examination of the concept of truth going on here. Most of the people Charlie meets have created different personas to help them deal with themselves. “You call it a lie, I call it my truth,” as Amber says. But is Charlie really any different? Opposing versions of truth unfold wherever she goes, and she detects them unfailingly, but Charlie is on the run from reality too. While Poker Face is awash with memorable cameos – this time, expect Awkwafina, Method Man, Giancarlo Esposito and many more – the most telling is Rhea Perlman’s casino owner Beatrix Hasp. Beatrix represents grim destiny, the end of the road for Charlie. Poker Face never dodges reality (and how could it, given its premise?), but it never stumbles under its own weight either. This show is irreverent fun with a big moral heart and a very human sense of chaos and jeopardy, and it never forgets to give us what we need. How much longer can the Barracuda keep rolling? With Charlie at the wheel, I hope we have a long road trip ahead of us. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-08
Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Tim Crouch’s experimental play An Oak Tree is pure magic,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/an-oak-tree-young-vic-review-tim-crouch-jessie-buckley-b2746376.html,"This theatre landmark has been around for 20 years, but it still continues to create something new and uncomfortable It’s been 20 years since Tim Crouch’s experimental theatre landmark An Oak Tree first premiered, with hundreds of actors taking on the challenge over the decades, but this anniversary production still feels winningly tender and tentative, not authoritative. Each night, Crouch guides a different performer through a script they’ve never seen before. And as they stumble over unfamiliar lines, he performs a magic trick: transforming their real discomfort into the crackling tension between two characters bound together by grief and guilt. On opening night at the Young Vic, it’s the wonderful Irish actor Jessie Buckley braving the stage, one of a formidably starry line-up that also includes Adjoa Andoh, David Tennant, Meera Syal and Russell Tovey. And no wonder: for these massive actors, it’s a test. A risk. A way of injecting liveness and spontaneity into careers running along smooth rails. Buckley feels especially exposed on stage, her visible pregnancy adding a level of vulnerability that’s countered by the confident way she throws herself into the part – she falls to her knees playing uproariously virtuoso air piano, and when Crouch says “Ain’t she beautiful?”, she waggles her tongue mock-lasciviously and caresses her rounded torso. He’s in persona as a creepy stage hypnotist, dressed in a silvery waistcoat and playing naff disco muzak over his speakers. And she plays everyone else – all the audience members at his failing, faltering gig – and Andy, a middle-aged man whose daughter this fumbling entertainer seems to have accidentally killed. Watching An Oak Tree is sometimes – often! – an uncomfortable, frustrating experience. More than once, Crouch’s words are inaudible over the sound of piped traffic noise: at other moments, he stutters, heightening the artificiality of this entertainer’s patter by not letting it feel suave or confident. “Are you OK? Say yes,” this weird, bald puppet-master instructs Buckley, who doesn’t have room to insert her own words into a script that takes her in increasingly uncomfortable directions. But then, grief takes control away, too. Crouch’s most powerful writing comes when death stops haunting the edges of the play and crashes into its centre, instead, emotions collapsing into abstracts. “She spoke two concrete blocks in black... left them inside me to this day,” says Andy, remembering what it felt like to hear the worst possible news. There are so many unsettling layers here, as Crouch switches the mood, steers us joltingly from one version of reality to another. But the potential chilliness of Crouch’s formal experiment is subverted by Buckley’s bubbling warmth and impulsivity – her nervous laughter, steely controlled stare, or unexpected hug of total relief. On another night, with another performer, it will feel totally different. But it’ll stay evergreen, for the way it exposes theatre’s oldest tricks – the power plays, the charm, the liveness, the risk – and repurposes them into something jarring and new.

Independent,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Emma Jane Unsworth: ‘Women are told to feel ashamed of our fantasies’,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/emma-jane-unsworth-interview-slags-book-b2743222.html,"The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. The author of ‘Animals’ and ‘Adults’ talks to Helen Coffey about drugs, booze and oblivion, creating characters ‘that are fun to be around’ and why sibling relationships can be the most complicated of our lives I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Ask me anything at all – I’m really unoffendable!” Emma Jane Unsworth has unwittingly uttered the phrase every interviewer longs to hear – though the invitation isn’t that surprising. It feels reassuringly on brand for the author of some of the past decade’s most daring and subversive books exploring the millennial and Gen X female experience. You only have to read Animals, her gritty, zeitgeist-capturing 2014 novel about two friends “ruining their bodies” by living in a constant state of off-their-tits hedonism, to know that here sits a writer unafraid to grasp the nettle of boundary-pushing subject matter. Described as “Withnail for girls” by an admiring Caitlin Moran, the book was subsequently adapted into a feature film starring Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat. Unsworth’s follow-up, 2020’s Adults, traverses the thorny territory of miscarriage, mental health and social media addiction; her latest novel, the provocatively titled Slags, is an equally unflinching foray into first love, fantasy and sexual identity. “It’s got to be a bit scary, I think, hasn’t it?” Unsworth says of her work. “Quite often I’m cringing when I’m writing, and quite often I’m terrified – like, ‘shall I put this? Really?’” That rawness translates into realness on the page; Unsworth has a knack for sketching out nuanced characters who feel viscerally alive. Slags is no exception, told from the perspective of 41-year-old Sarah as she and her younger sister, Juliette, embark on a birthday road trip to Scotland, which segues into an uncomfortable yet poignant trip down memory lane. While Unsworth’s women are often plagued by inner turmoil and darkness, they are also whip-smart and belly-laugh witty – unlike a lot of the wilting protagonists found in the trendy “sad girl” literary trope. “We should be allowed to contain all these multitudes – able to be very funny, but also really troubled and lost and messy,” she says. “For me, that’s what carries the momentum, the joy in that sharp dialogue.” You can get away with a lot, she adds – and have characters doing “pretty awful things” – if you make them fun to be around. “Then your readers will come along for the ride and enjoy it.” Unsworth thrums with energy when I meet her at a London café in the build-up to publication day. Clad in wide-legged, white pin-striped trousers with a matching waistcoat, she’s the kind of effortlessly cool forty-something woman who would be intimidating were it not for her instant, disarming warmth. Pale skin is complemented by strawberry blonde curls, tamed and pulled away from her face; dark blue eyes are clear and bright as she talks a hundred miles a minute in her subtle Mancunian twang. “A few weeks ago, I felt sick with nerves,” she admits of Slags’ forthcoming release. “Now, I’m calm. It’s in the hands of the book gods.” The book’s plotleaps back and forth through time, oscillating between Sarah as an adult and as a teenager. Do we ever truly shake off the identity that is set for us in those formative years? “I think we come of age over and over again in life,” Unsworth answers thoughtfully. “And I think at those points, that’s when we feel like we’re defined. That definition, when you’re young, can be so shaped by other people, so much to do with what other people tell you that you are.” Her own teen self was “gobby”, loud and attention-seeking – but she “wasn’t very solid”. “Part of the inspiration for the book was just wanting to make myself, the teenage me who’s still inside, more resilient,” Unsworth says. Fifteen-year-old Sarah fits the same mould. With so many hormones kicking around, she sizzles with power and confidence yet is quivering with fragility and innocence beneath the brash facade. It’s an affliction that, Unsworth believes, impacts teenage girls no matter which era they’re born in: “You have all this desire and a burning urge to express yourself and work out who you are and put yourself out there. But at the same time, you’re really vulnerable.” How can we empower and protect teenage girls at the same time? “I feel like that’s what we need to do, but I don’t know what the answer is. The book is in some way an exploration of that dilemma.” She posits that female fantasy could be one essential outlet, offering young women agency and autonomy in a world that often robs them of both. The young Sarah lives inside a world of romantic make-believe so potent it seems to warp the very fabric of reality to fit the narrative in her head. “I think we’re encouraged to feel ashamed of our fantasies, especially women,” muses Unsworth. “It’s like a dirty, silly word, all frilly knickers and s*** porn. But actually, fantasies can be so nourishing and valuable and strengthening. I’ve definitely used them as such a healing place in my life.” Since her own adolescence, Unsworth has had a “big recalibration of who I am and what I want” about once a decade. Much of her former sense of identity was bound up in the vision of herself as the eternal “party girl”, epitomised by the uncouth, seize-the-night double-act in Animals (“I will always push the f***-it button. I love pushing the f***-it button,” she jokes). Her writing frequently explores the relationship between female characters and their drinking and substance-taking; there’s a fascination with the sometimes blurred distinction between addict and hedonist. Unsworth very much defines herself as the latter. For her, there’s always been something inherently romantic about the idea of intoxication; it symbolises “freedom, a tipping point”. “Addiction is a trap and it’s a disease, and it’s a terrible thing that ruins whole families and lives,” she says, “but for me, my relationship with drugs and alcohol has always been about oblivion. They represent a chaos that means you can be and do anything. It’s almost like a place you go and disintegrate from everything that society expects you to be…” I speak as someone who constantly questions whether it was the right thing for me to have children But there are some societal expectations it’s near-impossible to escape. Getting on it every night simply isn’t compatible with Unsworth’s current life as a mother of two young children and daughter of ageing parents; it’s a gear shift that part of her has fought tooth and nail against, part of her has submitted to. “Parenting is its own kind of joy, and its own responsibility – my children need a lot from me physically right now.” Having had kids in her late thirties, Unsworth both loves and wrestles with the role of “mother”. “Regret is something that interests me,” she says, “And I speak as someone who constantly questions whether it was the right thing for me to have children personally, as well as feeling very grateful that they exist.” While any big life decision feels heavy, the baby question is on a whole other level, she argues – “it’s such a gnarly one for women”. As someone who feels the absurd weight of that choice increasing exponentially the closer I get to 40 myself, the observation hits home. It’s a theme that’s adroitly navigated in Slags. Sarah is a Gen X workaholic who’s voluntarily single; her younger sister has done the marriage and kids thing. The former laments that “it is so hard to walk the walk of being a childfree woman”, even by choice – and though Unsworth is no longer walking that particular path herself, its challenges still resonate. “It’s really insidious, the way that pressures are put onto women to do certain things and be a certain way by a certain age,” she says. “We’re still advertised that it’s more valuable to have a life if you’re a mother, and that there’s only one way to be a mother.” But she has always fought to present a counter-narrative in her work – “different happy endings, different routes that are equally meaningful and valuable and fulfilling.” What’s perhaps most enchanting about Slags is the central relationship between the two sisters. It’s gratifying to see in literature what has been deftly achieved on screen in recent years in shows such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabagand Aisling Bea’s This Way Up: an irresistibly authentic depiction of the female sibling dynamic in all its knotty complexity.Sarah and Juliette hold a mirror up to one another, the only people schooled in their own secret language built on a lifetime of shared cultural references and experiences. Inspired by the relationship between Sarah and Juliette – they speak of a “heart alarm”, a golden thread attached to the ribs that runs between them – and my own sister/soulmate, I wonder aloud whether siblings can end up being the real loves of each other’s lives. “Oh, completely,” agrees Unsworth, herself a big sister (a status that, she believes, has defined every other relationship she’s ever had). “Who else do you have a shared history with like that?” She describes the relationship she has with her younger sister – three years Unsworth’s junior – as the “most complicated” of her life. After growing up together, you’re left with something that’s “extremely complex, durable, heartbreaking, terrifying but edifying,” says the author. On top of “big sister”, Unsworth has recently acquired two new labels following an ADHD and autism diagnosis last year. The former was expected; the latter, not so much. The revelation has prompted her to probe the interplay between neurodivergence and intoxication. “It’s made me think about how much I’ve used things like alcohol, because it’s a coping mechanism, at parties and things like that – as well as really enjoying it.” But there’s undoubtedly been a generational shift when it comes to getting s***-faced. In Slags, Sarah is dabbling in sobriety but finds it painfully boring; she mourns “the slow limp of Saturday nights where no one went out any more to pound pavements with their passion or fury”, noting that Gen Z prefer coffee and conversation to pubs and clubs. Though she’s not judging the next generation, Unsworth doesn’t necessarily believe the shift from binge-drinking to wellness culture has been as “healthy” as it sounds. Every now and then, you just need that big fire for your head “The ideas about what’s beautiful and the way that women should look… sadly, it’s not all this free and easy wellbeing goodness,” she says. “I actually think there’s still a lot of pressure and a lot of anxiety, a lot of damage being done to people.” She believes there’s something to be said for letting go and losing control on occasion, arguing that a big night out can cut through life’s noise and stresses. “It feels like a cleanse, when everything’s razed to the ground,” she says wistfully. “Every now and then, you just need that big fire for your head...” A cognitive reset is as likely to come from the shocking temperature change between the beachside sauna and ice bath in Unsworth’s adopted home town of Brighton as it is from mind-altering substances these days. But it might not be that way forever. She has a fantasy of herself in her seventies, running around Soho, drinking and dancing and having a wild old time. I can picture it too: silver curls untamed; eyes still clear and bright; a cocktail in one hand and a large glass of wine in the other. “I think there’ll always be a party girl in me,” she says with a smile. “She’s having a little bit of a nap at the moment – but she’s going to be back on her feet raging again in the future.” Slags is published by HarperCollins on 8 May Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-08
Independent,Sports,Doohan’s Alpine axe a ticking time bomb and reveals F1’s cold truth,https://www.independent.co.uk/f1/jack-doohan-alpine-f1-colapinto-briatore-b2746411.html,"Doohan lasted seven races at Alpine, while Liam Lawson was two and out at Red Bull. With Franco Colapinto being handed a simple five-race deal, another change could be in the offing after Silverstone in July I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice How long has the writing been on the wall for Jack Doohan at Alpine? About four months. The moment Franco Colapinto was acquired from Williams as a reserve driver in January, it did not take a mastermind to ascertain that the Australian’s tenure in a race seat was set to be short-lived. It was a ticking time bomb of a driver seat. The last 24 hours of chaotic announcements emanating from the Alpine press office also tell us what we’ve known, Netflix and all, since his shock return last summer: Flavio Briatore is at the wheel of the ship. A ship on very rocky waters. Many will be sad to see former team principal Oliver Oakes depart; a mild-mannered character, his first foray into F1 from junior formula did not even last 12 months. The Brit resigned on Tuesday night, with Briatore assuming all his responsibilities. Twelve hours later, Colapinto’s five-race deal was confirmed. An internal disagreement over the driver swap? You do the maths. Briatore’s return to the paddock is a moral complex in itself. The 75-year-old Italian maverick was given a lifetime ban from the sport after the infamous 2008 Crashgate scandal, in which it was alleged that the then-Renault boss and chief engineer Pat Symonds instructed their driver, Nelson Piquet Jr, to crash in order to assist a win for Fernando Alonso, which came to fruition. Briatore and Symonds denied the charges, but Renault did not contest them in a 2009 FIA hearing. Yet Briatore himself contested his lifetime ban in a French court and had it overturned. Technically, he has been allowed to return to the sport since 2013. A brutal taskmaster, Briatore featured heavily in the most recent season of Drive to Survive, his most memorable appearance being when he told Doohan: “I control you every millimetre.” His corrupt past does undoubtedly casts a shadow over his return now. Liam Lawson – 2 races, Red Bull 2025 Yuji Ide – 4 races, Super Aguri, 2006 Nicolas Kiesa – 5 races, Minardi 2003 Jack Doohan – 7 races, Alpine 2024-25 Nyck de Vries – 10 races, AlphaTauri 2023 Karun Chandhok – 10 races, HRT 2010 *discounting temporary stand-ins Perhaps the only solace for Doohan, as he reacclimatises to his former life as a back-up once again, was that he started one more race than the early-season rumour of five grands prix and out. The 22-year-old also lasted four races longer (five if you include his appearance at last year’s season-finale in Abu Dhabi) than Liam Lawson, after his demotion from Red Bull to sister team Racing Bulls following just two races. Yet with Lawson the unwanted record holder of the shortest stint in a full-time F1 seat, Doohan now takes his place in fourth on the list. It presents a somewhat complex story surrounding rookie drivers in F1 currently. On one hand, six rookies (if you include Lawson) received a drive this year, a record number. Kimi Antonelli has hit the ground running at Mercedes, Ollie Bearman has shown flashes of brilliance at Haas and Gabriel Bortoleto is being afforded time at Sauber, given their lack of competitiveness. Isack Hadjar has also been an unlikely star at Racing Bulls. Terrific for those who believe in the philosophy of giving youth a chance, in any sport, at any level. Yet, contrastingly, is a shot at the big time even worth it if you’re only allowed a handful of races to prove your worth, as was the case with Lawson and Doohan? Knowing that one weekend could wreck your career trajectory, is the pressure too high? Clearly, a 20-car grid lends itself to a frenetic driver market. Colapinto’s impressive nine-race stint at Williams at the end of last year – in the knowledge that a full-time seat was not feasible in 2025 – made the much-loved Argentine the big wildcard heading into this season. Williams were happy to let Colapinto head for pastures new. Briatore came calling, got his man, and now hands him his shot, starting at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix next week. But he does not have long to leave a lasting impression. Briatore makes it clear that the 21-year-old has until Silverstone in July – not even the summer break, two races later – to prove his worth. At that point, merely halfway through the 24-race season, the spot of Pierre Gasly’s teammate will be reassessed once again. What’s more, as harsh a call as it is on Doohan, he has not done enough. Two costly crashes – one on lap one of his home race in Australia and another in practice in Japan – were indicative of a driver under the cosh before he was even in the cockpit. Clearly, a first-lap collision with Lawson and subsequent retirement in Miami were the final straw. Yet sympathy will be radiating throughout the paddock. Doohan spent the opening weeks of his debut season, which should have been some of the most exciting of his life, rebuking queries about Colapinto’s arrival. The season launch event in London saw a sharp response to one query, with an Alpine press officer refusing to allow any more questions on Colapinto. All in all, it felt uncomfortable. But now the torch passes to Colapinto. Briatore made clear that Alpine’s horizons are set on new regulations next year – when they will take Mercedes engines for the first time – and they want to finalise a solid driver line-up for 2026. Pierre Gasly seems set to be their leader and the Frenchman has even mentioned targeting a world championship next year, as outlandish an ambition as that seems. But who will be his teammate? Colapinto has a mere five grands prix to show his mettle. Doohan and fellow reserve Paul Aron remain waiting in the wings, eager for a call-up from the unpredictable Briatore. A chance could be on the cards again ahead of Spa-Francorchamps in late July. Two years ago, the axing of Nyck de Vries after 10 races felt brutal. Now, some drivers would be desperate for that number. Rookies are being handed their chance but with an unprecedented catch: get up to speed quickly, or you’re out. The sport has never been so ruthless to its newbies. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",2025-05-08
Independent,Sports,Champion Pogacar’s absence leaves Giro d’Italia field wide open,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/giro-d-italia-tadej-pogacar-primoz-roglic-juan-ayuso-b2745860.html,"The defending champion may be skipping the corsa rosa but his absence leaves the door open to compatriot Primoz Roglic I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice There will be no repeat of Tadej Pogacar’s masterclass at the 2024 Giro d’Italia. “Pink Pog” will not be back to defend the title he barely worked up a sweat in securing last year, to the dismay/relief (delete as appropriate) of observers and the rest of the cycling world. But in the absence of cycling’s present, this year’s Giro line-up features its past and future. The out-and-out favourites are Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe’s Primoz Roglic, a four-time Vuelta champion and Giro winner in 2023, who may count himself unlucky to be only the second-best Slovenian cyclist of all time. The 35-year-old will go toe to toe with Pogacar’s disciple, young Spaniard Juan Ayuso, who is searching for his first grand tour title. A far cry from Pogacar’s procession to Rome last year, the 2025 edition should be a serious fight. The pair did battle in a fascinating Volta a Catalunya in March, with momentum swinging between the two even over the course of individual stages. On the final day, Ayuso looked to have the upper hand but Roglic – never one to underestimate – ultimately won in dominant fashion with a final-stage 20km solo to victory. But the Giro is quite a different beast. And with two time trials, a plethora of hilly stages, and a trio of difficult mountain stages in the final week, the fight for the title could go right down to the penultimate day. Victory for Ayuso would underline his status as Pogacar’s second-in-command at UAE Team Emirates-XRG, and perhaps fuel a desire, occasionally sensed bubbling under the surface, for a greater share of the limelight than he is awarded at the super-team. For Roglic, this would prove to all his younger competitors – the likes of ex-teammate Vingegaard, Pogacar, and Remco Evenepoel – that he’s very much still a player in this game. Beyond the two front-runners, this Giro is shaping up to be one of its most open editions in some time. UAE Team Emirates-XRG have a second card to play in Adam Yates, a super-domestique and a man with grand tour pedigree himself, having finished third in the Tour de France in 2023. Bahrain-Victorious have home hopeful Antonio Tiberi, who impressed last year, finishing fifth. Visma-Lease a Bike have winter signing Simon Yates, who won the Vuelta in 2018 and moved for another shot at grand tour glory, as well as Wout van Aert, an all-terrain machine who was in fine form during the spring classics, although a win eluded him. Frenchman Romain Bardet may not be a serious contender for the title but will certainly hope for a good showing at his final grand tour before his retirement from road racing. Then there’s Tom Pidcock. His Q36.5 squad have been granted a wildcard for the Giro – no doubt a direct result of his star power – and the Brit has had an excellent spring to kickstart life with the team. This is the 25-year-old’s first grand tour post-Ineos and offers him a fresh start. He’ll be the undisputed leader, and while his ProTour outfit doesn’t have the same calibre as some of the other squads, the team has looked revitalised since he joined over the winter. The Olympic mountain bike champion, Pidcock has proved himself capable on almost all terrain and, as such, has a decision to make on how he attacks this race. Q36.5 may not be able to support a full-on tilt at the general classification and the maglia rosa, but a number of early hilly stages certainly suit him and a top 10 placing at least looks within his grasp. It seems feasible that the team may make their decision on what he should target, whether it be stage-hunting or a full GC campaign, as the race goes on. And what of Pidcock’s former team? Ineos Grenadiers have selected an intriguing line-up, mostly consisting of common-or-garden domestiques, solid if not spectacular. It feels a squad largely built around the GC challenge of Thymen Arensman, a second-tier three-week racer who could be well positioned to strike if either of the favourites show signs of weakness. He looked to capitulate early in last year’s corsa rosa, losing four minutes in the opening few days, before resurrecting himself and building an admirable challenge in the final week to finish sixth for the second year in a row. The Ineos squad also leaves possible room for Egan Bernal, a sparkling talent who likely could have rivalled Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard in recent years had he not been on the mend from a hideous, life-threatening crash in early 2022. The Colombian has shown flashes of his early brilliance this year, winning both the road race and time trial national titles and impressing at Clasica Jaen before being sidelined with a collarbone fracture. A return to the form that saw him win the 2021 Giro – Ineos’s last grand tour title – feels unlikely, but his presence gives the team options. The other Ineos rider of note is 21-year-old British talent Josh Tarling, a time-trial specialist and all-round engine, and one to watch for breakaways and possible stage wins.
