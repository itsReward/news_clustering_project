iHarare,Business,Ministry Of Transport Apologises For False Claims On Victoria Falls Road after Being Accused Of Corruption,https://iharare.com/ministry-of-transport-apologises-for-false-claims-on-victoria-falls-road-after-being-accused-of-corruption/,"The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development in Zimbabwe has issued an apology after it posted incorrect information on social media, falsely claiming that contractors were already on site for the Victoria Falls Road project. The apology came after social media users, including investigative journalist Hopewell Chin’ono, accused the government of corruption in the tender process. “The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development wishes to unreservedly apologise to members of the public and all its stakeholders,” read a statement posted on 29 April 2025. The original tweet, published at 9:18am on 29 April, stated that “all eight contractors involved in the project are now on site.” But this claim was false — the tender process had not even closed at the time. Hopewell Chin’ono reacted strongly to the false claim on X (formerly Twitter), saying the government had exposed itself. “They floated a tender for the repair of the Bulawayo–Victoria Falls Road, and the closing date for this tender process is today, 29 April 2025,” he posted. “Yet… the Ministry of Transport’s Twitter handle [says] all the contractors are already on site.” Chin’ono said this could only mean one thing: “Mnangagwa gave the tender to his cronies in exchange for kickbacks and bribes!” He went further, suggesting there may be whistleblowers inside the Ministry: “Perhaps tweeting this is a deliberate move by progressive people inside the regime who are fed up with Mnangagwa’s shameless public procurement criminal cartels.” In a formal retraction issued later the same day, Permanent Secretary Eng. P.J. Makumbe clarified the actual state of affairs. “The Ministry acknowledges that no contractor is on site, as the tender process is still ongoing.” The Ministry explained that the tweet was posted without verification from technical officials: “One of the officers… acknowledged that she breached the internal Standard Operating Procedures of information verification.” The tender, issued on 17 April, closed at 11:00am on 29 April 2025. According to the Ministry: “An evaluation committee will sit, whereupon the outcome will be sent to the Special Procurement Oversight Committee before awarding the same to successful bidders.” Despite the mix-up, the Ministry stressed its commitment to transparency: “The Ministry remains committed to the need for sharing correct information to members of the public.” Follow Us on Google News for Immediate Updates",2025-05-08
iHarare,Business,RBZ Hands Out US$10 Million to 135 Companies Through Targeted Finance Facility,https://iharare.com/rbz-hands-out-us10-million-to-135-companies-through-targeted-finance-facility/,"RBZ Hands Out US$10 Million to 135 Companies Through Targeted Finance Facility The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has pumped ZiG300 million (around US$10 million) into the economy through a special funding facility aimed at boosting key industries. Since January, 135 private sector companies have benefited from the initiative, which offers affordable loans to support economic growth. According to RBZ data, the agriculture sector was the biggest winner, with 60 companies accessing funds from the Targeted Finance Facility (TFF). The manufacturing sector wasn’t far behind, with 53 companies benefiting. Meanwhile, 18 firms in the wholesale and retail space also got a slice of the funding, and the construction and energy sectors saw four companies each receive support. RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu explained that agriculture and manufacturing were prioritised because of their crucial role in driving Zimbabwe’s economic growth. “In line with the facility objectives, the manufacturing and agriculture sectors received the biggest share of the funding, given their significant contribution to domestic production. An analysis of historical growth trends of the Zimbabwe economy shows that strong recovery in agriculture and manufacturing production has had significant positive impacts on the economy,” Dr Mushayavanhu said. Also read: ‘We no longer need the black market’: Why Zimbabwean Manufacturers Are Now Turning Away From Parallel Forex Dealers The TFF, launched by the RBZ at the start of 2025, is designed to boost the economy without causing inflation. It does this by offering low-interest loans to productive industries, while keeping the country’s tight monetary policy intact. Under the TFF, banks borrow money from the central bank at 20% interest and are allowed to on-lend to businesses at a maximum rate of 30%. Loans are short-term, with a maximum repayment period of 270 days. Borrowers can take out and repay loans in ZiG or foreign currency at the current exchange rate. Dr Mushayavanhu expressed satisfaction with how the facility is working. “Overall, the TFF has enabled the Reserve Bank to make available targeted liquidity to the productive sectors of the economy, while maintaining its current tight monetary policy stance, aimed at durably reducing inflation to low and sustainable levels,” he added. Speaking virtually at the ZITF 2025 International Business Conference last week, Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube assured businesses that government will continue to tighten the screws to make sure the TFF stays effective and truly benefits the economy.

iHarare,Business,Why Zimbabwe Seized Land From Black Farmers During Land Reform Program Under Mugabe: Presidential Spokesperson Explains,https://iharare.com/why-zimbabwe-seized-land-from-black-farmers-during-land-reform-program-under-mugabe/," Zimbabwe’s presidential spokesperson George Charamba has revealed why some Black farmers lost land during the country’s controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme under former President Robert Mugabe in the early 2000s. Writing on the social media platform X, Charamba explained that some Black farmers were used by white farmers to try and protect their land from government takeover. “At the height of Fast Track Land Reforms, a number of black Zimbabweans became parapets behind whom hid several white farmers who sought to deflect and defeat the programme,” wrote Charamba under his X handle @Jamwanda2. “In short, white farmers would ‘transfer’ their farms to those blacks in the hope of saving the farms from acquisition.” Charamba’s post came in response to prominent lawyer and businessman Tawanda Nyambirai’s claim that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had personally intervened to restore land to him and other Black Zimbabweans who lost their farms under the first republic. Tawanda Nyambirai revealed that he lost his land because of political abuse of the system by powerful figures. “In my case, it was the late General Mujuru who abused the system and targeted me,” Nyambirai wrote. “His main target was Mr Strive Masiyiwa as was later explained to me by the former First Family… When HE discovered that the situation was too dangerous for me after my brothers were kidnapped, he advised me to vacate the farms and wait for sanity to prevail before vindicating my rights.” Nyambirai said he was eventually helped by the late Vice President Msika and Chester Mhende. He added that President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was the speaker of Parliament then,  was supportive and had even advised him to step aside temporarily to avoid violence. Nyambirai confirmed that he followed all the legal steps to reclaim his farms. He said the land was restored after 20 years, thanks to direct intervention from President Mnangagwa. “Upon being reminded that I lost my farms under the First Republic, the President directed that my farms be restored,” he said. “I followed the prescribed legal process and indeed the title to my farms was restored after 20 years. We are now in the final stages of taking back possession.” Nyambirai also mentioned that the group he belongs to includes other Black farmers who held land through companies. Charamba responded by thanking Nyambirai for clarifying the history. “Thank you for clarifying matters for the sake of truth and history. Kune vanga voshandisa your case to badmouth Land Reforms. Anyway, justice was restored and we are happy for you and your family,” Charamba posted. He added that not all land losses were the same. “I would never put landless blacks as a population in the same group with Rhodesian landed gentry, thereby creating a false impression their SCARS were comparable,” Charamba said. He concluded by noting that Zimbabwe’s land issue continues to draw global interest. “It’s not fortuitous that the Zim land issue is being revisited now when Trump has pronounced himself on SA’s racist land policies,” he said.

iHarare,Business,Zimbabwe Returns Seized Farms To Black Farmers Who Lost Land Under Mugabe,https://iharare.com/zimbabwe-returns-seized-farms-to-black-farmers-who-lost-land-under-mugabe/,"The government of Zimbabwe is now restoring farms to black farmers who lost their land during the controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme under former President Robert Mugabe, businessman and lawyer Tawanda Nyambirai has revealed. Writing on social media platform X, Nyambirai said the directive to return the farms to black indigenous farmers came from President Emmerson Mnangagwa himself. “Upon being reminded that I lost my farms under the First Republic, the President directed that my farms be restored. I followed the prescribed legal process and indeed the title to my farms was restored after 20 years,” wrote Nyambirai on 24 April 2025. “We are now in the final stages of taking back possession. My Senior Brother, Nic Vingirai was also assisted. We have an association of black indigenous farmers who lost land. We are all grateful that the Government, especially the President himself, has stepped forward to give us redress.” Nyambirai revealed that an organised group of black indigenous farmers who had lost their land had formed an association to engage the government and navigate the legal process. When asked if the group included companies that lost land during the programme, he replied: “Some members of the group held their farms through their companies.” He stressed the importance of acknowledging progress, saying: “We must always give credit where it is due.” Presidential spokesperson George Charamba responded positively to the news, thanking Nyambirai for shedding light on the issue. “Thank you for clarifying matters for the sake of truth and history. Kune vanga voshandisa your case to badmouth Land Reforms. Anyway, justice was restored and we are happy for you and your family.” Nyambirai went on to give more personal context about how he lost his land. He said the late General Solomon Mujuru had targeted him, and that the real target was telecommunications magnate Strive Masiyiwa. “In my case, it was the late General Mujuru who abused the system and targeted me. His main target was Mr Strive Masiyiwa, as was later explained to me by the former First Family,” he revealed. Nyambirai explained that President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was the speaker of Parliament at the time,  had tried to help but ultimately advised him to leave his farm for safety after his brothers were kidnapped. “HE [President Emmerson Mnangagwa] did his best to assist me after he was requested to help me by the late VP Msika and by a dear friend, Mr Chester Mhende. “When HE discovered that the situation was too dangerous for me after my brothers were kidnapped, he advised me to vacate the farms and wait for sanity to prevail before vindicating my rights. “HE was for land reform, but not for the violence. HE always believed that some cases deserved compensation and that land must have title.” He also mentioned that Mnangagwa had played a behind-the-scenes role in trying to assist. “I was privileged to know the side of HE that is hidden to many. If I was better at making friends, I would have had the privilege of being closer to him.” The restoration comes nearly 20 years after the farms were seized. “Justice was restored,” Charamba concluded in his reply.

The document, which is believed to be a leaked cabinet memorandum, proposes major constitutional changes. Among them: scrapping a section of the constitution that prevents sitting leaders from extending their terms; a move that could allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputies to stay in power until 2031. Other proposals include giving Parliament up to three more years beyond its current five-year limit and shifting control of voter registration from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to the Registrar of Births and Deaths. Speaking exclusively to NewsHub, the minister dismissed the document as fake and slammed social media users for spreading what he called “false documents.” He made it clear that if any constitutional changes were coming, they would be done transparently and not in the shadows. “I am sick and tired of social media manufacturing and circulating these false documents. This is not the process the government follows when passing a bill. The bill is a public document, and there is no need to get excited. When the government has finalised it, it will be in the public domain for debate. As the government, if we propose a bill, we do not do so in secrecy. The procedure is public,” he said. While denying that the viral document was legitimate, Ziyambi hinted that Zanu PF might still be working on its own constitutional changes behind the scenes. “Mine is coming, wait for it. I do not discuss these matters in secrecy. When it is released, you will see it, and it will be gazetted, not these fabricated documents,” he said.

iHarare,Politics,Paul Mashatile Explains Delay in Beefing Up Security After Assassination Attempt,https://iharare.com/paul-mashatile-explains-delay-in-beefing-up-security-after-assassination-attempt/,"Paul Mashatile Explains Delay in Beefing Up Security After Assassination Attempt Deputy President Paul Mashatile has opened up about the recent alleged assassination attempt on his life and why his security hasn’t been increased amid allegations that his assassination attempt was staged. Mashatile was returning from an ANC meeting in Boksburg when shots were fired at his convoy. At first, he thought someone was throwing stones at his car. But it quickly became clear that it was gunfire. Speaking during a visit to Greater Ivory Park Zone 15 in Soweto, where he was honouring freedom fighters who were killed by police in 1987, Mashatile addressed the issue head-on. He was asked by eNCA journalist Pule Letshwiti-Jones why his security hadn’t been beefed up following the incident. Mashatile explained that security decisions are not up to him or the President. Those calls are made by the country’s security agencies. He explained: “Well, the President and Deputy President don’t determine their security. It’s an assessment done by the security cluster. At the moment, we are convinced that both the President and Deputy President have adequate security. If they think they need to beef up, they will do so.” While Mashatile downplayed the need for changes, police leadership has already taken action behind the scenes. In a statement issued Tuesday night, police commissioner Fannie Masemola’s spokesperson, Athlenda Mathe, confirmed that extra protection had been deployed for both President Cyril Ramaphosa and his deputy. “General Fannie Masemola confirms the reinforcement of security detail to both principals and has also expressed gratitude with the manner in which members of the Presidential Protection Service (PPS) safeguard and handle the safety of both principals. Members of the PPS who are assigned to both the President and the Deputy President are trained to a high level of skill and possess the necessary expertise and capabilities to avert any risk and threat. The resources assigned to safeguard the executive are also adequate and designed to prevent any direct and imminent threat on their lives,” she said.

iHarare,Politics,Geza Drops Bombshell: Says Zimbabweans Must Stay Away INDEFINITELY Until Government Changes,https://iharare.com/geza-drops-bombshell-says-zimbabweans-must-stay-away-indefinitely-until-government-changes/,"Controversial war veterans’ leader Blessed “Bombshell” Geza has thrown Zimbabwe into further uncertainty after declaring that the planned two-day stay-away protest has now become indefinite. The outspoken political activist said Zimbabweans must continue to stay away from work, schools, businesses, and public life until President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government is removed from power. The announcement marks a dramatic escalation in Geza’s strategy following the failed 31 March street protests and the initial call for a shutdown on 22 and 23 April 2025. Instead of a short-lived demonstration, Geza now says the country must grind to a complete and indefinite halt. Blessed Geza speech
– Stayaway now indefinite until ED steps down
– he says shops should give people food for free. They will be compensated by the new govt
– people will be told where to get food in due course pic.twitter.com/aCuRQKTz6b — Zim Media Review (@ZimMediaReview) April 21, 2025  According to Geza, the indefinite shutdown is the only remaining peaceful method for Zimbabweans to express their frustration with the ruling ZANU-PF government. He instructed workers, teachers, transport operators, vendors, and business owners to withdraw their labour and stay home until the regime collapses. He said that the indefinite shutdown would show the world that Zimbabweans had lost confidence in Mnangagwa’s leadership. In his message, Geza insisted that shops should remain closed, public transport should stay off the roads, and schools and industries must not open their doors. The country, he argued, must stop functioning entirely to force political change. Geza believes the government is now attempting to consolidate power by illegally extending the president’s term of office. He alleged that Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, Attorney General Virginia Mabhiza, and Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda were spearheading plans to push Mnangagwa’s rule to 2030 without a constitutional referendum. He claimed the government would try to offer term extensions to MPs as a way to buy their silence and support. In response to these claims, Geza made it clear that the stay-away would continue without interruption until a new administration takes over. Following the arrest of over 100 activists during the March demonstrations, Geza has turned to civil disobedience rather than street protests. He explained that peaceful resistance through non-participation was now the only safe way to protest in Zimbabwe, where the security forces have been accused of using brutal methods to shut down opposition. He argued that the judiciary, Parliament, and the police have all been captured by the executive, making traditional protest methods ineffective. In his view, by staying indoors and refusing to participate in the economy, Zimbabweans could cripple the state without putting themselves in harm’s way. Geza, who is still on the run from police, said the authorities could not arrest people for choosing to stay at home. He believes that by shutting down the country’s daily operations, Zimbabweans would paralyse the system and highlight the failure of leadership without lifting a single placard. He acknowledged the risk and hardship that comes with an indefinite shutdown, particularly for those in the informal sector. However, he urged the population to make short-term sacrifices for long-term change, saying Zimbabweans could no longer afford to wait. The reaction from the public has been mixed. While some have shown support for the indefinite stay-away, calling it a powerful act of resistance, others expressed concern that such a strategy would worsen the economic crisis for ordinary people. Many Zimbabweans earn a living through informal trade and casual labour, and staying at home indefinitely could result in massive hunger and suffering. Some have proposed more strategic action, such as regular stay-aways once a week to build momentum without collapsing livelihoods. Others have warned that the government may respond with heavy-handed tactics if the protest starts to affect the flow of money or public perception. Despite this, Geza appears unmoved and determined. He has doubled down on his demands, stating that the only acceptable outcome is the complete removal of Mnangagwa and his allies from power. Until that happens, he says Zimbabwe must remain silent, ungovernable, and immobile. The government has not officially responded to Geza’s latest threats, but security forces are expected to be on high alert starting Monday, 22 April 2025, when the shutdown is set to begin.

In the now-deleted clip, Chivayo was travelling with his wife Lulu Mutekede and others in an SUV. As he filmed the car’s interior, the camera briefly showed the car radio—clearly playing “Kumusoro” by Winky D and Nicky Genius. The gospel-inspired track, off Nicky Genius’ 2022 album Ndokutendai Nei, is widely recognised by Winky D fans. Although Chivayo muted the original audio and replaced it with Jah Prayzah’s latest song Ibvapo, eagle-eyed fans were quick to spot the song info on the screen. “It clearly shows ‘Kumusoro’ – a collaboration between Nicky Genius and Winky D,” said one user. “Why mute the sound unless you didn’t want people to hear it?” Chivayo, an avowed ZANU PF supporter and activist, has not responded to comments online asking whether the music was his personal choice.

Just three months ago, he ridiculed the musician on social media for allegedly seeking his attention. Writing on X (formerly Twitter) in February, Chivayo said: “TRUE STORY… aedza kutsvaga attention yangu but I’ve never offered him anything because he’s a puppet we opposition. 🤣🤣🤣 ngavaite GO FUND ME to him even a Rolls Royce Phantom vaone kuti kana inokwana AQUA inobuda here.” This came after speculation that Winky D was bitter about not receiving a luxury vehicle like other musicians aligned with the ruling party. Chivayo went further, telling Winky D’s fans to crowdfund a car for him if they truly supported him. This was after Winky D’s fiery lyrics.  In his EP Love Potion, released on his birthday, the singer appeared to take direct aim at Chivayo: “Vanoti nemuzita rababa, apa ndofuti vaba, vhura meso hona ka, handitengeke nemota car.”(They preach the word of God but they are the ones stealing. Open your eyes. I can’t be bought with a car.) The rivalry between the two hit a peak in January 2025, when Winky D performed in Mbare for the first time in seven years. During the show, he took multiple lyrical swipes at Chivayo and others aligned with Zimbabwe’s ruling party. In a fiery performance, Winky D continued: “Ndabva paJabhuna horaiti chiitai, musandipe tuma notes handina teacher ini, ndapfuura 40 handidi teacher ini…”(I left HICC, it’s fine, do your own thing. Don’t give me notes—I’m not a student anymore.) Observers say this was likely aimed at fellow Zanu PF supporter Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who was linked to booting Winky D out of HICC. While Chivayo continues his spree of gifting cars to artists aligned with the ruling party, Winky D has taken a different route—declaring his independence through lyrics. “Handitengese. Handisi Peter. Ndendiri zii, handina noise, handisi speaker ini,” Winky D added during his Mbare set.(I’m not for sale. I’m not Peter. I stay silent—I’m not the loudspeaker.) Whether Chivayo intended to play Winky D’s music or not, the video has fans talking—and speculating. “That was Kumusoro playing. We all saw it,” one Facebook commenter noted. “Deep down, he knows the music slaps.” “So Wicknell bashes Winky D in public but vibes to his music in private? The hypocrisy is real!”  said another user. Others found humour in the situation. “Even Wicknell can’t resist Winky D’s music—who can blame him?” joked another.
