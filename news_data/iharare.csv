iHarare,Business,"Govt Flags Hefty Monthly Salary, Bonuses and Lavish Perks for NSSA Boss",https://iharare.com/govt-flags-hefty-monthly-salary-bonuses-and-lavish-perks-for-nssa-boss/,"Govt Flags US$15K Monthly Salary, Bonuses and Lavish Perks for NSSA Boss The Government, through the Corporate Governance Unit (CGU) in the Office of the President and Cabinet, has raised concerns over the hefty salary and benefits proposed for National Social Security Authority (NSSA) General Manager Dr Charles Shava. The CGU has recommended that the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare step in to address the issue. Dr Shava has been serving as NSSA’s acting general manager since July 2022 and recently emerged as the top candidate for the permanent role, beating out six other contenders. According to documents reviewed, NSSA proposed a basic monthly salary of US$15,730 for Dr Shava. Forty percent of this was to be paid in United States dollars, with the remainder in Zimbabwean dollars. However, the CGU has intervened, calling for a downward review. It cited Section 20 (2) of the Public Entities Corporate Governance (PECG) Act, which limits executive compensation to between 30 and 70 percent of a public entity’s revenue or operational budget. The NSSA board also proposed a performance bonus amounting to 25 percent of the annual salary, about US$47,280 per year or US$3,940 per month. While the CGU agreed with the 25 percent cap, it stressed that such bonuses must be strictly performance-based and tied to the organisation’s overall achievements. A 10 percent representation allowance — roughly US$1,730 — was also proposed to cover Shava’s official duties, but it was flagged for review along with other benefits. Also read: NSSA to Increase Monthly Pension Payouts by 66% The proposed contract included the provision of a house in one of Harare’s low-density suburbs, but the CGU rejected this outright. It is advised that if accommodation is provided, it must be leased at market rates under a formal agreement. The contract also offered full coverage of school fees for up to three children, benchmarked against institutions like Prince Edward School and Africa University. However, the CGU recommended limiting this to government primary and secondary schools, and capping university fees to public institutions such as the University of Zimbabwe or Harare Polytechnic. The allowance would exclude exam fees and levies, and payments would only be made upon submission of invoices. The CGU further declined a request for full coverage of subscriptions to three professional bodies, noting that such costs should not be fully covered by the employer. A number of additional perks were flatly rejected. These included: 24-hour home security Full DStv bouquet Two domestic workers Paid holidays for the general manager and spouse in business class, with up to four children flying economy A US$3,000 holiday allowance per person A vehicle loan equal to the annual gross salary Payments for personal development According to the CGU, these proposals were inconsistent with the current public sector remuneration guidelines and must be removed from the final contract.

iHarare,Business,5 Ways Travel Brands Can Leverage Digital Marketing to Boost Sales,https://iharare.com/5-ways-travel-brands-can-leverage-digital-marketing-to-boost-sales/," In today’s digital landscape, travel brands face intense competition for consumer attention. With travelers spending over five hours consuming online content before booking and 80% preferring to book trips entirely online, implementing effective digital marketing strategies is no longer optional-it’s essential for survival and growth. The travel industry is uniquely positioned to benefit from digital marketing due to the highly visual and experiential nature of its offerings. Next, we examine 5 strategies travel brands can leverage to boost sales. Search engine optimization forms the foundation of any successful digital marketing strategy for travel brands. When potential travelers begin their journey, they typically start with Google, making your website’s visibility in search results crucial. Start by ensuring your website is technically sound. Mobile responsiveness is particularly important, as a significant portion of travel bookings come from mobile devices. Page speed is another critical factor-travelers will quickly abandon slow-loading websites in favor of faster alternatives. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to identify and fix speed-related issues. Effective keyword research is essential for travel brands. Focus on three key types of keywords: Incorporate these keywords naturally throughout your website content, including meta titles, descriptions, headers, and body copy. For example, your meta title might read: “Explore Exotic Destinations with XYZ Travel Agency | Affordable Tours & Packages”. For travel businesses with physical locations or those targeting specific destinations, local SEO is invaluable. This includes: By prioritizing local SEO, you increase your chances of appearing in search results when potential customers search for terms like “hotels near me” or “best tours in London”. Link building remains one of the most powerful ways to improve search rankings and drive targeted traffic to travel websites. Partner with established travel bloggers and influencers whose audience aligns with your target market. This approach not only generates quality backlinks but also exposes your brand to highly engaged potential customers. When seeking collaborations: Travel is inherently local, making location-specific backlinks particularly valuable. Target: These links not only improve SEO but also drive highly qualified traffic from users already interested in specific destinations. Create comprehensive, data-driven content that naturally attracts links. Examples include: Focusing on creating linkable assets and strategic outreach can significantly increase website visitors and backlinks over time. Content marketing allows travel brands to inspire potential customers throughout their booking journey, from initial destination research to final purchase decision. Develop in-depth destination guides that answer common traveler questions and showcase your expertise. These guides should: Storytelling is particularly effective in travel marketing. Rather than simply listing features, craft narratives that help potential travelers imagine themselves experiencing the destination. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then videos are worth millions-especially in the travel industry. Visual content brings destinations to life and gives audiences a sense of what their experience could be like. Invest in: Video content has seen explosive growth on platforms like TikTok, which has become increasingly influential in travel decision-making. A large percentage of users report they are likely to book a holiday based on recommendations seen on the platform. Encourage customers to share their experiences with your brand. User-generated content serves as authentic social proof and can be repurposed across marketing channels. This approach builds trust while reducing content creation costs. Social media platforms offer travel brands unparalleled opportunities to inspire potential customers and drive direct bookings. Each social platform requires a tailored approach: TikTok deserves special attention for travel marketing, as it has become increasingly influential in travel decision-making by highlighting unique destinations and experiences. Complement organic social media efforts with targeted advertising. Personalized ad experiences that match users’ interests, behaviors, and preferences create more relevant and engaging connections. For example, sending targeted ads for tropical getaways to someone recently browsing beach vacations significantly increases engagement. Beyond link building, influencer partnerships can significantly expand your reach on social media. Select influencers whose audience demographics align with your target market and who can create genuine, compelling content about your offerings. Email marketing remains one of the most effective digital channels for travel brands, offering exceptional ROI. Create targeted email campaigns based on customer data such as: This segmentation allows you to deliver highly relevant content to specific traveler groups rather than generic mass communications. Develop a variety of email types to engage customers throughout their journey: For online travel bookings, abandoned cart emails can significantly boost conversion rates. Send follow-up emails to customers who begin but don’t complete their booking process, potentially offering incentives to encourage completion. The digital marketing landscape offers tremendous opportunities for travel brands to increase visibility, engage potential customers, and ultimately drive bookings. By implementing comprehensive SEO strategies, building quality backlinks, creating compelling content, leveraging social media platforms, and utilizing personalized email marketing, travel brands can create a cohesive digital presence that converts browsers into bookers. The most successful travel brands will integrate these strategies into a cohesive plan, consistently measuring results and adapting to changing consumer preferences and platform algorithms. As the travel industry continues to evolve, those who master these digital marketing fundamentals will gain a significant competitive advantage in capturing the attention and loyalty of today’s digitally-savvy travelers.

iHarare,Business,Crude Moves: Navigating the Global Oil Trading Landscape,https://iharare.com/crude-moves-navigating-the-global-oil-trading-landscape/,"Crude Moves: Navigating the Global Oil Trading Landscape The global oil trading landscape is a complex web of economics, geopolitics, and environmental considerations. As the lifeblood of modern economies, crude oil drives industries, fuels transportation, and shapes international relations. Understanding the dynamics of this ever-evolving market is crucial for stakeholders, from energy companies to policymakers and investors. For more detailed insights and updates, visit our main website, where we explore the key forces shaping oil trading, emerging trends, and strategies for navigating its challenges. The Mechanics of Global Oil Trading Oil trading operates on a vast scale, with millions of barrels exchanged daily through spot markets, futures contracts, and long-term agreements. Major benchmarks like Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) set the pricing standards, influenced by supply-demand dynamics, production costs, and market sentiment. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, play a pivotal role in stabilizing prices by adjusting output levels. Trading hubs such as London, New York, and Singapore facilitate transactions, while physical oil moves through pipelines, tankers, and refineries. However, the market is not just about physical barrels. Financial instruments like futures and options allow traders to hedge risks or speculate on price movements, adding layers of complexity. Geopolitical Influences on Oil Markets Geopolitics is a constant driver of oil price volatility. Conflicts in oil-producing regions, such as the Middle East, can disrupt supply chains, sending prices soaring. For instance, tensions in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for oil tankers, have historically triggered market uncertainty. Similarly, sanctions on major producers like Russia or Iran can reshape global supply patterns. Trade policies and diplomatic relations also matter. The U.S.-China trade relationship, for example, impacts oil demand, as China remains one of the world’s largest importers. Meanwhile, Russia’s pivot to Asian markets following Western sanctions illustrates how geopolitical shifts redirect oil flows. The Rise of Sustainable Energy and Its Impact The global push for sustainability is reshaping oil trading. As countries commit to net-zero goals, demand for renewable energy is rising, potentially capping long-term oil consumption. Electric vehicles (EVs) and advancements in energy storage are reducing reliance on gasoline and diesel, particularly in developed economies. However, oil remains indispensable for now, especially in developing nations and industries like petrochemicals and aviation. The transition to greener energy creates a paradox: while long-term demand may decline, short-term supply constraints—due to underinvestment in new oil projects—can drive price spikes. Traders must navigate this delicate balance, anticipating shifts in demand while managing immediate market realities. Technological Advancements in Oil Trading Technology is transforming the oil trading landscape. Big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) enable traders to process vast datasets, from weather patterns to refinery outputs, for better price forecasting. Blockchain technology is streamlining transactions by enhancing transparency in supply chains, reducing fraud, and cutting costs. Digital platforms are also democratizing trading. Smaller players can now access real-time market data and compete with industry giants. These tools empower traders to make informed decisions, but they also intensify competition, demanding agility and precision. Strategies for Navigating the Oil Trading Landscape To thrive in this volatile market, traders and investors must adopt robust strategies: Conclusion Navigating the global oil trading landscape requires a deep understanding of market mechanics, geopolitical risks, and emerging trends. While volatility remains a constant, opportunities abound for those who can adapt to change. By leveraging technology, diversifying strategies, and staying ahead of the energy transition, stakeholders can turn challenges into advantages. The crude market is dynamic, but with the right moves, it’s a landscape ripe for exploration.  Follow Us on Google News for Immediate Updates",2025-05-18
iHarare,Business,Spotting Undervaluation: When Market Fear Creates Buying Opportunities,https://iharare.com/spotting-undervaluation-when-market-fear-creates-buying-opportunities/,"In the financial markets, fear can be a potent force. It often prompts investors to sell stock, resulting in underpriced assets. However, astute investors know that times of market anxiety may provide fantastic chances. Who wouldn’t want to purchase that undiscovered treasure at a reduced cost? This article examines how market overreactions may cause short-term mispricing, how specific indications might indicate cheap companies, and strategies for identifying value in underappreciated industries. Continue reading (and bring your curiosity) if you’re wondering how to transform fear into opportunity. Visit https://bitcoins-union.com/ to learn more. A low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is often the first sign of an undervalued stock. It represents the relationship between a stock’s current price and its earnings per share. A lower P/E may signal that the stock is inexpensive relative to the company’s past earnings. But, before jumping in, don’t forget to investigate why the P/E ratio is low. Sometimes, it’s low for all the wrong reasons, like poor management or industry troubles. Another metric to consider is the price-to-book (P/B) ratio, which compares a company’s stock price to its book value (what the company is worth if liquidated). A P/B ratio of less than one could indicate that the stock is trading for less than its net assets. It’s like buying a dollar for 90 cents—provided the company isn’t in financial chaos. When analyzing these ratios, always compare them to industry averages. A low P/E or P/B might seem attractive, but if it’s common within that sector, it might not mean much. Also, check for red flags in the company’s financials like excessive debt or declining revenue. Markets can be irrational, and that presents opportunity. If bad news causes panic, stocks can be sold off faster than logic dictates. This often creates temporary dips in stock prices. Imagine hearing your favorite coffee shop might close, only to find out it’s just under renovation—you’d probably regret dumping a gift card for pennies on the dollar. Here’s an example. Suppose a solid company announces a temporary issue, like a recall or executive resignation. These events might scare investors short-term, leading to a price dip. However, the business fundamentals likely remain intact, meaning the price could recover. When irrational fear strikes, patient investors benefit. The lesson here? Good things can come from short-term chaos. To act on such mispricing, stay informed. Regularly read company statements and analyze whether the “panic” aligns with long-term prospects. Often, some sectors are like underrated indie movies—off the radar but packed with potential. These undervalued sectors attract little attention because they’re either boring or misunderstood. However, they may contain companies with significant upside. Look for trends. For instance, renewable energy was once an overlooked sector but has gained traction in recent years. Similarly, small-cap stocks, often ignored due to their size, can offer big rewards if you research them carefully. Remember, low attention doesn’t always mean low value! How do you start digging into these gems? No one is saying this is foolproof. But identifying emerging opportunities often requires you to go where everyone else isn’t looking. Think of it as playing detective with a financial twist. Remember, neither is enough on its own. Rely on research and talk with financial experts to validate your theories. Spotting undervaluation requires time, patience, and a lot of research. Low P/E and P/B ratios can be useful indicators, but context is key. Market overreactions are another avenue for opportunity, but only if you’re willing to avoid emotional decisions. Lastly, exploring overlooked sectors might lead you to unpolished diamonds. Before any move, always consult trusted financial advisors or resources. After all—and here comes the irony—opportunity favors the well-prepared.

iHarare,Politics,Outrage as Zimbabwe’s Deputy Health Minister Claims “Varwere Chaivo Are Not Complaining About Our Services”,https://iharare.com/deputy-health-minister-accuses-tino-machakaire-of-lying/,"Deputy Health Minister Accuses Tino Machakaire of Lying Deputy Minister of Health and Child Care, Sleiman Timios Kwidini, has responded to public outrage over the state of Zimbabwe’s healthcare system — but his comments have only added fuel to the fire. The backlash began when Youth Empowerment Minister Tino Machakaire publicly criticised the poor condition of public hospitals, accusing the Mnangagwa-led government of ignoring serious issues affecting the people. His honesty was rare and raw, and it quickly sent shockwaves across social media. But during a Question and Answer session in Parliament on Wednesday, 7 May, Deputy Minister Kwidini brushed off the concerns, saying the public criticism online was exaggerated. He insisted the Ministry of Health had done “wonders” since 2018. “On the part of the social media, indeed, people on social media always talk about what is not happening in the Ministry, but as the Ministry, we are doing wonders since 2018, to make sure the citizens receive quality care,” Kwidini said. Kwidini went even further, claiming that people who have used public hospitals are actually pleased with the services. “What we are doing is only known by the patients, not the social media participants. As we speak right now, Mr. Speaker Sir, our citizens are very happy with the service delivery that we are giving,” he added. That last statement triggered a flood of angry and sarcastic comments online, with many Zimbabweans expressing disbelief. Here are some of the comments: _nn.e__: Common sense is running after him, and he is faster. pablo_zw1: Ma citizens ari happy api asi Mune mamwe ma citizens atisingazive here. iishe_01: Vamwe vanhu denga vachangonzwa kunhuwirira kwaro …zvekuzosvika ikoko iih 🙌🙌 lord_ricky_w.w: It’s so painful and sad at the same time that these people are the ones that tarnish the party’s movement when there have more to say and less to do for there nation 💔 _.tyress: Munhu ari paComa anotaura here😂 Follow Us on Google News for Immediate Updates",2025-05-18
iHarare,Politics,Wicknell Chivayo Faces Parliament Probe Over US$100 Million ZEC Tender Scandal,https://iharare.com/wicknell-chivayo-faces-parliament-probe-over-us100-million-zec-tender-scandal/,"Wicknell Chivayo Faces Parliament Probe Over US$100 Million ZEC Tender Scandal Flamboyant Zimbabwean businessman Wicknell Chivayo is facing possible investigation by Parliament after a formal petition was submitted by a Kwekwe-based activist. The activist, Emmanuel Nkosilathi Moyo, has called on the legislature to invoke its oversight powers to probe alleged money laundering involving Chivayo in the controversial US$100 million Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) tender. In his petition addressed to Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda, Moyo urged MPs to examine the dealings of Chivayo’s companies, citing concerns over illicit financial activity linked to public funds. He referenced Sections 119, 298, and 299 of the Constitution, as well as Standing Orders 159(2) of the National Assembly and 149(2) of the Senate, which give Parliament authority to scrutinise the use of public resources. Central to Moyo’s petition is a report by South Africa’s Financial Intelligence Centre (SAFIC), which raised red flags over potential criminal conduct in the tender deal. The report could not rule out money laundering or other illegal financial activities. According to SAFIC, Chivayo received a staggering R800 million (about US$40 million) from a total of R1.2 billion (US$66 million) paid to Ren-Form CC, a South African company contracted to supply voting materials for Zimbabwe’s August 2023 general elections. The report revealed that Chivayo used multiple personal and company accounts to move the funds around rapidly through transfers and cash withdrawals, raising further suspicion. The money moved through major South African banks, including FNB, Standard Bank, and Absa. Some of the funds were reportedly spent on luxury items, including designer clothes, high-end vehicles, electronics, real estate, and international travel. Moyo said Parliament must investigate how taxpayer money was used and ensure transparency and accountability in government spending. He emphasised that the US$100 million deal was funded by the public purse. Also read: WATCH: Wicknell Chivayo Secretly Jams to Winky D – After Publicly Bashing Him?

On 2 May, Tanzania officially outlawed the use of foreign currencies like the dollar and euro for buying goods and services within the country. All local transactions must now be done in Tanzanian shillings. The regulation, which came into effect on 28 March, also prohibits businesses from quoting or advertising prices in foreign currency or refusing to accept the local currency. Reacting to the news, Charamba posted a message on his X account (@Jamwanda2) on 6 May, sharing the Bank of Tanzania’s statement and jokingly wrote: “IF TANZANIA DID IT, WE CAN DID IT TOO!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣” Also read: “ZiG Only By 2030?”: Mthuli Ncube Sets Conditions for Phasing Out US Dollar in Zimbabwe His post sparked a flurry of reactions, with many Zimbabweans divided on whether such a move would work in their country.

iHarare,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,No love lost: Springbok WAG visits divorced Rachel Kolisi (pictures),https://iharare.com/no-love-lost-springbok-wag-visits-divorced-rachel-kolisi-pictures/,"Springbok WAG Hope Mortimer gave Rachel Kolisi a much-needed visit, a moment to offload since Siya Kolisi divorced her.  WAGS are more than glamorous partners—they’re pillars of strength behind the scenes. These women understand life in the spotlight. They face pressure, long-distance, and public attention. But above all, they uplift one another. When one of them stumbles, another is there to pick her up. Their sisterhood runs deep, especially during life’s darkest moments. Whether it’s parenting, heartbreak, or personal growth, these women rally together. Through brunches, check-ins, and heartfelt chats, they find healing. They celebrate wins but, more importantly, offer comfort in storms. In a world that rarely pauses, these WAGs make time for each other. Hope Mortimer, the elegant girlfriend of Jesse Kriel, recently made a heartfelt visit to Rachel Kolisi. It came at just the right time. Rachel had been through some of life’s toughest challenges. The fires threatened her home, and her divorce from Siya Kolisi hit hard. She had been honest about her emotional struggles. What she truly needed was a friend—someone to sit, sip wine, and just talk. Hope brought exactly that. Their time together was filled with laughter, vulnerability, and healing. “Much needed catch-up with Hope,” Rachel later wrote. Those simple words carried deep meaning. Sometimes, the right person arrives just when the weight gets too heavy. And Hope, full of grace and empathy, showed up for her friend. During divorce and emotional setbacks, friends become lifelines. For Rachel, that lifeline came in the form of Hope. Supportive friends don’t always offer solutions—they listen, they show up. They pour the wine, hold the silence, and help carry the emotional load. Healing takes time, but a strong base of support makes it bearable. WAGs like Hope remind us that behind every strong woman is a friend who helps her believe again. Follow Us on Google News for Immediate Updates",2025-05-18
iHarare,Arts/Culture/Celebrities,Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2025 Prizes Revealed,https://iharare.com/miss-universe-zimbabwe-2025-prizes-revealed/,"Prizes Revealed for Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2025 The stage is set for the Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2025 grand finale, which will take place at the Harare Hippodrome on Saturday, 17 May. Nine stunning finalists from across the country are preparing to compete for the prestigious crown — and the exciting prizes that come with it. Originally, ten contestants were expected to take part, but one has pulled out. Charlotte Muziri withdrew just before boot camp, citing a scheduling conflict. She had already committed to another project — the World Fashion Exhibition in France — and chose to honour that booking. The remaining nine hopefuls are: Onesimo Nkomo Samkhele Dhlamini Charmaine Emmanuel Chiedza Mhosva Brenda Kadewe Rumbidzai Muzopa Annie Grace Mutambu Talic Magaiza Lyshanda Moyo Each brings something unique to the competition, making this year’s edition especially compelling. This year’s competition features more than just fresh faces. It also includes former pageant queens who have already made their mark on the runway. Chiedza Mhosva, Miss World Zimbabwe 2017, and Annie Grace Mutambu, Miss Zimbabwe 2015, are both vying for another shot at glory. In another refreshing twist, the 2025 edition includes married women, like Chiedza and Onesimo — the latter a proud mother based in Bulawayo. Lyshanda Moyo, meanwhile, is reportedly engaged. The winner will take home a brand-new car, a cash prize (to be announced on the night), and the honour of representing Zimbabwe at the Miss Universe pageant later this year in Thailand. The winner will take over from outgoing queen Sakhile Dube. On Wednesday night, Sakhile hosted a dinner for the finalists, where she offered words of encouragement and shared tips from her own experience. She praised the calibre of this year’s contestants and pledged to support the new queen as she prepares to take on the global stage in Thailand.
