      "content": "Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism, as Karl Matchett reports I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The mood around UK business has ranged from cautious to desperate in the past few months as the economy battles inflation, tax grabs, rising labour costs and the prospects of US tariffs. Add in constant political pressures giving a bleak outlook and the stock market plummeting in early April on the back of those tariffs, and UK plc could be forgiven for thinking 2025 might become a year to forget. But perhaps all is not as bad as it was beginning to appear, with some important signs giving relief and optimism to some businesses who got a share price backing boost thanks to the world\u2019s biggest investor, BlackRock, building stakes in multiple companies. And the most imminent boost will be a cut to interest rates. The Bank of England meets on 8 May and a 0.25 per cent cut appears all but guaranteed at this stage. And back-to-back rates cuts are entirely possible, bringing the Bank Rate down to 4 per cent by summer. It would be the first time since March 2023 that the interest rate returns to that level, easing costs for business owners with debt and perhaps allowing more consideration to investment on projects and other spending which could spark opportunities for the growth the economy desperately needs. Some businesses already look well-positioned to capture that growth, believes Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock. \u201c[The company has] allocated more capital back to the UK tactically now with the belief that in the short run, the new administration is trying to tackle some of the hard issues,\u201d Mr Fink toldThe Times. \u201cI think the prime minister is articulating the needs of what we have to do. I have more confidence in the UK economy today than I did a year ago.\u201d Pointing to some of the financial institutions that had seen their share price hammered this year as the FTSE 100 dropped along with other major stock markets, Mr Fink explained how BlackRock had taken stakes in different sectors in the belief the selloff was overdone. \u201cSo many of the UK stocks discounts were too deep, especially like in the banking system. Look at the rebound in the valuations of NatWest and Lloyds and how they bounced. We added to our positions across the board with the idea that we believe the market was discounting too much negativity. And we believe the negativity was probably not warranted,\u201d he said. Having seen a significant drop from 3 April onwards, the FTSE 100 - the biggest firms on the London Stock Exchange - have bounced back somewhat and now remain up more than two per cent since the start of 2025, even if they have collectively not reached March\u2019s high points. Interest rate drops - while affecting households in terms of mortgages, savings accounts and so on - also impact investing. That is in part due to lower guaranteed returns from cash or like-cash holdings, meaning more risk may be taken on in the form of stock market equities. Rising share prices help improve investor and business confidence, while consumers may then benefit from having more money in their own pockets if rate drops mean they pay less on mortgages and other debt. There are further positives in other sectors. Retail sales rose almost half a percent in the UK during March, and that came ahead of April when the rise to minimum wage kicked in meaning more money in some workers\u2019 pockets. Jacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said: \u201cGlimpses of warmer weather and improving consumer confidence meant retail sales continued its upward trend in March. Sales volumes rose for the third consecutive month, reaching their highest level since July 2022. The first quarter of 2025 suggests consumer spending is slowly starting to return, which should provide some reason for optimism in the retail sector.\u201d Then there\u2019s analysis from Barclays, showing both wage growth easing and contraction in employment. Both of these factors will further ease pressure on the Bank of England when it comes to deciding rates cuts. Small wins they might seem, and with little impact of individuals, but as we so often see in businesses, it\u2019s those small wins adding up continuously which lead to the potential to outperform. Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism.

      "content": "A 71 per cent drop in profits and tanking share price have forced Elon Musk to cut down his time as Trump\u2019s costcutter-in-chief. Alicja Hagopian and Karl Matchett explore what happened I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice At the start of the year, Tesla\u2019s share price was at an all-time high. Elon Musk, owner of the electric vehicle giant, was coasting on the win of his ally Donald Trump, and investors were hedging their bets that soon-to-be-President Trump would enact policies in favour of Tesla and the billionaire\u2019s other companies. But with an astronomical fall in share price, tanking sales and shrinking profits, the reality for Tesla has been far different \u2013 and much of it is tied to Musk\u2019s public-facing role in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla stock once made up the majority of Musk\u2019s wealth, but now it is reporting huge drops in profit. The decision to step away from DOGE may show that Musk is not immune to Tesla\u2019s downfall. Within one month of Musk\u2019s appointment to DOGE, Tesla shares were down 16.5 per cent. Within two, Tesla\u2019s share price was down 45 per cent from when Trump came into office. And Musk himself has lost an estimated $149 billion in wealth since taking the helm at DOGE; at $301 billion compared to $449 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index. Tesla\u2019s share price problems have been far from cosmetic. The business is facing significant headwinds, not least because of the intertwined reputation with its notorious leader. In January and February, Tesla sales in Europe saw sudden dips, of 45 per cent and 39 per cent respectively year-on-year - despite steady growth in the European electric vehicle (EV) market. The numbers behind this week\u2019s latest earnings reports are, as expected, not pretty. Quarterly profits of $409m contrasted starkly with last year\u2019s $1.4bn figure for the same three months - and the 71 per cent drop represents the company\u2019s lowest quarterly profits since 2020. Actual vehicle sales reported this month were down 13 per cent to a little over a third of a million across the January to March quarter, with notable declines in China and parts of the US, while revenue of $19.3bn fell short of forecasts by more than $2bn and operating margins fell to 2.1 per cent. \u201cEarnings margin of 2.1 per cent is the lowest since Tesla approached break-even in 2019,\u201d said Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot. \u201cFree cash flow dipped to $660 million, but did not enter negative territory as capital expenditures were nearly halved compared to the prior year due to reduced investments. \u201cTesla has [also] effectively removed its growth guidance for this year, no longer promising a return to growth in 2025.\u201d Additional factors affecting sales include competition from China\u2019s BYD (Build Your Dreams), which undercuts Tesla on price, while frequent recalls of Tesla vehicles may also be doing little to boost confidence in the brand. But it is impossible to ignore a major factor impacting its brand: Musk\u2019s growing unpopularity. Musk has made no secret of his increasingly controversial political viewpoints. From accusations of a nazi salute at the inauguration, to criticising Volodmyr Zelensky as \u201cevil\u201d over the war in Ukraine, it is easy to see how his actions have ruffled feathers. As a result, a string of attacks have targeted Teslas in Europe and the US over the past few months, with clear anti-Musk messages. Tesla owners have faced threats to sell their cars over \u201cNazi Extremism\u201d in California, while even in the UK, campaign groups have applied pressure against Tesla cars and charging points. Tesla shareholders are pushing back against Musk\u2019s alignment with Trump; his decision to step partly away from DOGE indicates Musk is likely feeling the blowback himself. Investors may have hoped that Musk\u2019s role in the administration would see carveouts for Tesla in Trump\u2019s trade war. But in fact, the electric vehicle brand is far from immune. Tesla manufactures its electric vehicles in the US, which makes it less exposed to 25 per cent automotive tariffs than foreign brands. But the tariffs are not just on finished cars; there is also a 25 per cent levy on all imported automotive parts, and Tesla relies on many parts imported from China, in addition to Mexico and Canada: the company is dependent on imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to fuel its EVs, in particular using Chinese manufacturer CATL to supply its factories. And China\u2019s new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets have also impacted other projects from Tesla such as its Optimus humanoid robots. With Tesla dependent on batteries and rare earth products from China, the trade war will inevitably hit its supply chain. Following Tesla\u2019s plummeting profits, it might have been expected that the share price could drop further - but the opposite has happened. On Tuesday, the share price had risen 4.6 per cent; following the announcement of Mr Musk\u2019s intentions to resume greater oversight of corporate rather than Capitol Hill activities, that trajectory continued. Tesla shares are up more than seven per cent in pre-trading, set to open well above $250 per share - still a far cry from December\u2019s peak. Lowered expectations can explain part of it, as well as a broader desire from investors to see a bull run resume - from lower share price starting points. \u201cTesla\u2019s first-quarter delivery and production numbers were as ugly as its Cybertruck design. That meant expectations were rock-bottom in the run-up to its financial results and it\u2019s why the shares didn\u2019t tank upon release of the Q1 earnings,\u201d noted Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. \u201cCertain individuals are spotting an opportunity and might take the view that Tesla\u2019s significant share price decline has gone too far - they\u2019re buying on the dip, hoping for a bounce-back and might view the recent sell-off as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pick up shares in a previous stock market darling on the cheap. After all, the fundamentals still give bulls something to get excited about.\u201d Not everyone is quite as excited about those humanoid robots, self-driving taxis and energy storage products though. \u201cWhile Tesla is making progress on these initiatives, we believe the market and management commentary are overly optimistic about the timing. The narrative around Tesla\u2019s stock and valuation remains heavily dependent on these future prospects,\u201d Valechha cautioned. It should also be noted, the uptick isn\u2019t totally down to Tesla, Musk or anything to do with electrification - Trump\u2019s China tariff climbdown has sent the S&P 500 two per cent higher in pre-trading, with the likes of Amazon and Nvidia up four per cent each. Market volatility comes as standard in this second Trump term, and for Tesla which inadvertently became a crossover company to the political arena, that continues to go double.

Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s ambassador in Washington has said he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to negotiating with the US to \u201cbring down further tariffs\u201d. Lord Peter Mandelson told the BBC that Thursday\u2019s deal represents a \u201cplatform for going further and opening up more trade opportunities\u201d, as the Prime Minister declined to rule out the possibility of changes to tech taxes in a future trade deal. On Friday, Donald Trump\u2019s press secretary insisted that the president will stand firm on the blanket 10% tariff on most UK imports into the US, telling reporters that he is \u201ccommitted\u201d to the levy. The deal announced on Thursday cut taxes on car imports of 100,000 a year from 27.5% to 10%, and also reduced tariffs on steel and aluminium through quotas. The baseline 10% rate for other goods remains in place but officials are still trying to negotiate on it. Lord Mandelson told Newsnight: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with what we\u2019ve achieved. It\u2019s taken many months of very tough negotiation, and it\u2019s also a platform going further and opening up more trade opportunities.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to negotiate further and bring down further tariffs and remove further barriers to trade between us, that\u2019s what we\u2019re committed to, and I\u2019m looking forward to doing that.\u201d Karoline Leavitt told a White House press briefing that the US president is \u201ccommitted to the 10% baseline tariff\u201d imposed in April \u201cnot just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well\u201d. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told reporters on Thursday that the UK\u2019s conversations with the US about \u201cthose wider tariff lines and the 10% reciprocal tariff\u201d were continuing. It comes as Sir Keir Starmer did not rule out the possibility of changes to the digital services tax as part of any future trade agreement and said that discussions on other aspects are \u201congoing\u201d. It imposes a 2% levy on the revenues of several major US tech firms. Previous speculation suggested that the UK could revise the measure as part of a deal. Speaking to broadcasters on board HMS St Albans during a visit to Norway, Sir Keir said: \u201cThe deal that we signed off yesterday doesn\u2019t cover that. \u201cThat\u2019s predominantly focused on steel and aluminium, and reducing those tariffs on car manufacturing and reducing the tariffs there, and then future-proofing for pharmaceuticals, three really important sectors, and that, as I say, will be measured in thousands and thousands of jobs that will be protected, saved and will thrive as a result of this. \u201cOn digital services, there are ongoing discussions, obviously, on other aspects of the deal, but the important thing to focus on yesterday is the sectors that are now protected that the day before yesterday were very exposed.\u201d Lord Mandelson said that digital services were brought up during the negotiations for this week\u2019s agreement, and told the BBC that \u201cwhat they suggested wasn\u2019t acceptable to us, so it\u2019s not in the deal\u201d. The deal on Thursday is the first struck by the US since the new tariffs were unveiled last month, and comes after weeks of transatlantic talks. Sir Keir told the Independent that he has \u201cstruck up a good relationship\u201d with the president. \u201cI am the sort of person that tries to have constructive and positive relations with people,\u201d he said.

Speaking to reporters during a visit in Essex on Friday, the Conservative leader was asked whether she thought Thursday\u2019s deal was a success. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge success at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a trade deal, it\u2019s a tariff deal, and we are in a worse position now than we were six weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s better than where we were last week, so it\u2019s better than nothing, but it\u2019s not much. \u201cOne of the things that concerns me is that we will probably now not get a comprehensive free trade agreement.\u201d",

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/business/china-trade-negotiations",
      "content": "A few hours after President Donald Trump\u2019s trade negotiating team boarded a flight for the most important economic meetings in the world, their boss took to social media to publicly throw a curveball into the negotiations. That was the point \u2013 not necessarily the path. Trump\u2019s decision to float the possibility of cutting his 145% tariffs on China to 80% gave the impression that Trump was negotiating with himself before the discussions started. But the substance of the message, was not a surprise to his top negotiators, who have discussed the possibility of lowering America\u2019s tariff on China in internal discussions ahead of the US-China talks in Geneva, Switzerland. But it was certainly news to Chinese officials. Trump\u2019s feigned deference to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who he said in the post would make any final decision, was intended to elevate \u201cScott B\u201d in the eyes of his Chinese counterparts. In reality, US officials are clear-eyed about the fact it will be Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping who will ultimately need to cement any major agreement. Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer landed in Geneva, Switzerland, for two days of meetings with top Chinese officials eyeing what may be viewed as less ambitious, but no less important, outcomes. White House officials have made clear they view the China talks on a separate track than the furious scramble to secure trade agreements with dozens of other nations. Those negotiations are officially on the clock after Trump\u2019s decision to pause the April 2nd \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff rates for 90 days. Trump\u2019s advisors have framed some of those bilateral negotiations as another lever to exert pressure on China\u2019s economy, with a specific focus on securing early agreements with Indo-Pacific countries including South Korea and Japan. The White House approach to China is defined in its nascent stages as an altogether different approach separate and apart from the roughly 20 prioritized negotiations under way. Administration officials have framed a process intended to start with mutual steps toward de-escalation, followed by demands for specific moves by China to address Trump\u2019s priorities, such as the facilitation of fentanyl production and resuscitating the first term US-China \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal. Those steps would set the stage for more expansive discussions about the broader trade and economic relationship between the two nations. \u201cThis talk is about: Can we get to a stable place and maybe that\u2019s a foundation for something more,\u201d Greer said Thursday in an interview with CNBC. More immediate US concerns over export controls placed by China on rare earths may also drive potential early-stage agreements, but any kind of wide-ranging agreement is at best a long-term process. Unless, of course, Trump decides otherwise. Current and former administration economic advisors preface most conversations about negotiations with some variation of the fact Trump is the wild card that may decide to change course at any time. But Trump\u2019s advisers are using this weekend\u2019s meeting to forge a path out of a persistent and dangerous state of paralysis. They\u2019ve seen positive signals in the lead up to talks that, after a monthslong stare own, came together in a familiar and deeply choreographed way. Both sides announced the scheduled meetings in a roughly coordinated fashion. Both sides insisted their top negotiators just happened to be passing through a city that has long served as a neutral third-country site for the most contentious diplomatic relationships. Both sides have generally maintained their public red lines that would seem to ensure little progress, while also messaging a new degree of flexibility through associated outlets. The officials set to lead the talks from both sides are the most tangible sign that the talks are serious and designed to substantively move toward de-escalation. He Lifeng, Xi\u2019s top economic official and a long member of the Chinese leader\u2019s inner circle, will lead the Chinese delegation. Wang Xiaohong, Xi\u2019s top security aide, was also expected to attend, according to two people familiar with matter. Greer, who has engaged with most of the trade and economic officials expected to attend the meetings during his time across Trump\u2019s first and second terms, said the manifest represented \u201cfolks who are serious.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re sending real people to talk to us about real issues, so I\u2019m confident that we can have a straightforward and candid discussion with these folks,\u201d Greer said on CNBC. Bessent has become the public face of Trump\u2019s economic team. Greer, a senior trade official in Trump\u2019s first term who has played an increasingly central role within Trump\u2019s economic team since his February Senate confirmation, brings a similar level of gravitas for the US side. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who spoke to Bessent and Greer shortly before they boarded their flight Thursday evening, told reporters at the White House there have been \u201cvery promising signs\u201d from the China side ahead of the meetings. He called the lead up the meeting an environment both sides have approached with \u201crespect, collegiality and sketches of positive developments.\u201d That baseline level of professional diplomacy is a stark shift from the first month of Trump\u2019s second term, where Chinese officials tried in vain to connect with US counterparts and inner circle advisors, according to several people familiar with the matter. That left Chinese officials in a state of \u201cfrustration and confusion,\u201d according to a European diplomat briefed on the matter. What soon became clear, the diplomat said, was how serious Trump was about completely re-orienting the bilateral relationship \u2013 and that his method would be economic force. China\u2019s retaliation, which Trump and his advisors warned against, didn\u2019t come as a surprise. But it did deepen a rupture in the relationship that threatens the global economy and has already created significant stress on the domestic economies of both nations. US officials have made clear publicly \u2013 and maintain privately \u2013 that the Chinese economy simply can\u2019t sustain a drawn out trade war with the United States. They\u2019ve been bolstered in that view by recent economic data they say underscores a combination of existing fragility in the country\u2019s economic system and the acute risk posed by a de facto trade embargo with the world\u2019s largest economy. The American officials pointed to quiet outreach from Chinese officials that sparked the planning for the meeting, with a top Xi security advisor communicating a desire to work toward addressing Trump\u2019s major problems on the fentanyl issue. Trump\u2019s fixation with Xi and a potential sweeping economic deal has been a prominent public feature of his first and second terms in the White House, often to the chagrin of his most hardline advisors. They view his overarching assessment of China as clear-eyed and focused on mitigating economic and security vulnerabilities. But there are no shortage of very specific examples of his willingness to break from any kind of linear hawkish approach. The pursuit of a grand economic deal may tempt him once again. \u201cIt\u2019s his white whale,\u201d a first-term Trump White House official told CNN. \u201cThink of it like his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize \u2013 a huge China deal is the economic version of that.\u201d",

The sites, which allow people to wager on the outcomes of various events, brand themselves as \u201cprediction markets\u201d on the theory that when there\u2019s money on the line, they are better, in aggregate, at anticipating results. While they\u2019ve had some successes \u2014 notably, they bested traditional polls at predicting Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 election win \u2014 the market for betting on the next pope was blindsided by the conclave\u2019s election of Chicago native Robert Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV. Before the white smoke went up, Kalshi and Polymarket both cast Prevost as a long shot, with odds between 1% and 2%, which means a handful of gamblers who bet on Prevost won big.

Pietro Parolin and Luis Antonio Tagle were among the favorites heading into the conclave on Wednesday.

      "content": "Even as President Donald Trump pushes a message of self-sacrifice when it comes to how many dolls American children should own, his administration\u2019s first trade \u201cdeal\u201d includes a carveout for cars \u2013 luxury ones. Trump on Thursday hailed the fact that the US-UK framework for trade talks calls for lowering tariffs on UK cars, saying it wasn\u2019t his intention to persuade \u201csuper-luxury\u201d brands including Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar to build cars in the United States. According to a fact sheet shared by the White House, the Trump administration has already agreed to lower tariffs on the first 100,000 UK vehicles imported into the United States each year to 10%. Additional vehicles face a 25% tariff. \u201cWe took it from 25 to 10 on Rolls-Royce because Rolls-Royce is not gonna be built here. I wouldn\u2019t even ask them to do that. You know, it\u2019s a very special car and it\u2019s a very limited number too,\u201d Trump said, announcing the agreement with Britain in the Oval Office. During the same event, Trump floated slapping a 100% tariff on toys made by Mattel and attacked the company\u2019s CEO after the Barbie and Hot Wheels maker said its toys couldn\u2019t be manufactured in America and still be sold at affordable prices. The United Kingdom exported only about 90,000 cars to the United States last year, according to S&P Global Mobility, making it the sixth-largest source of imported vehicles, responsible for only 1% of imported cars. US Commerce Department data showed that the value of cars imported from the UK came to $12.3 billion, meaning that the average price of a British import was more than $135,000. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars. They make a very small number of cars that are super-luxury and that includes Bentley and Jaguar\u2026 some very special cars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s really\u2026 handmade stuff and they\u2019ve been doing it for a long time in the same location,\u201d he added, noting that he wanted to help the makers of such cars. Other luxury British car brands that could benefit from the lowered tariffs include Land Rover, Aston Martin and Mini. That means Trump has made it cheaper to import cars that relatively few Americans buy \u2013 or, for that matter, can afford \u2013 while keeping tariffs for now on more popular and affordable brands, mostly imported from countries other than the UK. \u201cLaser focused on reducing prices for everyday Americans from Day One,\u201d University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers posted on X, \u201cthe President has struck a deal that will lower the price of Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Jaguars, Aston Martin\u2019s, Range Rovers and Minis.\u201d Wolfers noted that \u201cno other consumer good received carveouts\u201d from the US-UK trade framework. Meanwhile, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said it\u2019s unlikely Trump\u2019s tariffs will cause toy manufacturing to come to America. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that happening,\u201d the Mattel CEO told CNBC after the company warned that tariffs will increase toy prices for American consumers. \ufeffTrump fired back, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won\u2019t sell one toy in the United States, and that\u2019s their biggest market.\u201d Trump added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wanna have him as an executive too long.\u201d Of course, a 100% tariff on America\u2019s leading toy company would likely cause an even bigger jump in toy prices charged to US consumers. It could also make it very difficult or virtually impossible for parents to buy new Barbies and other toys. Retailers typically start stocking up over the summer for the holiday shopping season. Ken Griffin, the hedge fund billionaire who backed Trump in the 2024 election, told CNBC this week that tariffs are a \u201cpainfully regressive tax\u201d that will \u201chit the pocketbook of hardworking Americans the hardest.\u201d In an interview with Politico, Griffin added that \u201ctariffs open the door to crony capitalism,\u201d with the government picking winners and losers. \u201cI thought this would play out over the course of years. It\u2019s terrifying to watch this play out over the course of weeks,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Maria Sole Campinoti contributed to this report.",

After a month of negotiations, we finally have a \u201cfull and comprehensive\u201d trade agreement with our old pals across the pond. Huge news! What a relief, right? Pop the champagne, the trade war nightmare is almost over\u2026 What\u2019s that? What\u2019s in it, you ask? Like, what is the \u201cdeal\u201d part of the deal? OK, so it\u2019s more of a concept of a deal. If a trade deal is, like, Michelangelo\u2019s David, this is more like a block of marble. Or really it\u2019s like a receipt from the marble guy that says we\u2019ve placed an order for a block of marble. Maybe put the champagne back in the fridge. Here is what the US and the UK announced Thursday: President Donald Trump\u2019s team took the US tax on British imports from 10% to *checks notes* 10%. Yes, it is the exact same tariff rate that Trump announced on April 2, but with some fun new carve-outs: That\u2019s honestly it \u2014 there are no more details, as both sides said specifics are still being ironed out. It\u2019s not all that surprising, given that traditionally trade deals require months or even years of painstaking talks. \u201cA trade agreement where the details are still being negotiated is not an agreement,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, on social media. \u201cThis does not provide the clarity necessary to lift the fog of uncertainty created by a trade war of choice.\u201d To hear the White House announce it on Thursday, though, you\u2019d think they just won a Nobel prize and a gold medal. In a Truth Social post, Trump said it was \u201ca very big and exciting day.\u201d Related article\nOne trade \u2018deal\u2019 done, 199 to go UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it \u201chistoric\u201d with what sounded like a straight face, though it should be noted he joined the Oval Office event via speakerphone, because the Trump administration cobbled this whole spectacle together at the last minute. (The British ambassador to the US even said that Trump called Starmer in a \u201cvery typical, 11th-hour intervention.\u201d) The Brits, for their part, said even an imperfect deal is better than no deal at all. Asked by reporters in England whether this deal marks an improvement on the US-UK relationship of six months ago, before Trump took office, Starmer replied: \u201cThe question you should be asking is: Is it better than where we were yesterday?\u201d Which is a gentle British way of saying: Look, we\u2019re all doing our little dances in the Trump show to avoid tempting the wrath of the leader of the world\u2019s biggest economy. Wall Street, similarly, isn\u2019t letting perfection be the enemy of the good. Stocks rallied in the US as investors \u2013 hungry for any sign Trump is going to relent on the trade war \u2013 embraced the White House\u2019s optimism. Just for kicks, let\u2019s say this is an actual framework for a real trade deal that will get hammered out over the next few weeks. That is better than nothing. But it took more than a month to roll out this titanic nothingburger with one of our closest allies. An ally that, with all due affection to our British brethren, accounts for just 3% of all US trade, Justin Wolfers, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, told CNN. That doesn\u2019t bode well for the thousands of American businesses that are currently paralyzed by Trump\u2019s 145% tariffs on most imports from China, an adversary that\u2019s not so charmed by the president\u2019s 11th-hour shenanigans and is America\u2019s third-largest trading partner. US and Chinese envoys are set to meet this weekend in Geneva. But American officials aren\u2019t even suggesting a trade deal will come out of it \u2013 the best that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he\u2019s hoping for is \u201cde-escalation.\u201d Bottom line: Very little has changed about the state of the global economy since the US-UK \u201cdeal\u201d was announced. We still have a 22% effective tariff rate today \u2013 the highest in more than 100 years \u2013 compared with 2.5% before Trump took office. \u201cOverwhelmingly the most important fact about today\u2019s trade deal is that the 10% across the board tariffs are staying,\u201d Wolfers said on social media Thursday. \u201cTiny tweaks here and there with some trading partners won\u2019t change that. The US is a high tariff country for the foreseeable future, and the trade war continues.\u201d",

      "content": "Just Google it. The phrase is a testament to just how synonymous the internet giant has become with finding information online as its services are now ubiquitous across everything from smartphones to laptops and even cars. But that success has come at a cost, according to the US government. Since 2023, two separate federal judges and a federal jury have ruled that Google has an illegal monopoly in its search engine, online advertising business and app store. Google is fighting to overturn those decisions, which could force the nearly $2 trillion company to split up \u2014 if that happens, it would mark the biggest breakup of a tech company since AT&T. And it\u2019s not just Google; Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have also faced antitrust scrutiny over how they operate their tech platforms. A breakup could especially hurt Google now, as AI surges and chatbots threaten to challenge its core business. Friday marks the end of a three-week series of hearings that could determine the future of one of the most important tech companies in history, potentially reshaping the way billions of people use the internet. A decision is expected in August. So how did Google get so big? The answer might be sitting in your hand. Today, Google is much more than a search engine. A series of acquisitions and product launches from the early 2000s put it at the helm of the most popular corners of the internet, from YouTube \u2014 which has become teens\u2019 most used social media platform \u2014 to the world\u2019s most popular web browser and most widely used smartphone software. \u201cThe friction to switch from Google to something else, it wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d said Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cWhy would you? You\u2019re not getting better results.\u201d Google\u2019s search engine took off in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it had a novel way of ranking results: by importance, based on how often other sites linked to them, shedding light on which websites had more credibility and relevance. Rivals like Yahoo and Ask Jeeves indexed web results more like \u201ca file folder\u201d organizing results by topic, according to David Brumley, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Google inked contracts worth tens of billions of dollars to make it the default search provider on iPhones, while also striking deals to preload its search engine and browser on Android phones. Those arrangements, the Justice Department and a group of states argued, along with Google\u2019s Chrome browser being so closely tied to its search engine, stifled competition in the search market. Last year, US District Judge Amit Mehta deemed those deals anticompetitive, calling Google a \u201cmonopolist\u201d in online search. The DOJ now wants Google to either spin off or make major changes to its Chrome browser and Android operating system. Google has said it plans to appeal the case and last month called it \u201cbackwards looking\u201d at \u201ca time of intense competition and unprecedented innovation.\u201d In the courtroom, Google argued that the DOJ\u2019s proposal would pose security risks, hamper Google\u2019s ability to invest in research and development, and harm Chrome as well as other businesses that rely on Google Search. It is instead proposing amending its browser agreements to allow companies to switch their default browser provider every 12 months, among other changes. Asked for comment on this story, a Google spokesperson pointed CNN to its public statements regarding the antitrust cases. As Google\u2019s search engine grew in popularity, so did its lucrative advertising business, which brought in $66.9 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2025. \u201cGoogle was able to basically sell a lot of ads because they were able to deliver the most eyeballs, and they were able to deliver a lot of, the most, eyeballs because they sold a lot of ads,\u201d said Siegel. Google also developed a technology \u201cstack\u201d that enabled brands to buy online ads and publishers to sell online ad space all through one company. In April, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that Google was able to \u201cestablish and protect its monopoly power\u201d by tying its ad server and publisher exchange together. However, she sided with Google by ruling against one of the government\u2019s claims related to the search giant\u2019s online advertiser ad networks. Related article\nGoogle is an online advertising monopoly, judge rules Google is also appealing that case, which could force it to divest part of its online advertising business or, more likely, restrict how it can operate or price its services. The DOJ is pushing for Google to sell two parts of its ad businesses to restore competition, according to a May 5 court filing. Historically, US regulators have left large companies alone if they had complementary, but not overlapping, offerings, only going after \u201cvertical\u201d mergers where companies bought up competitors, according to Abiel Garcia, a partner with law firm Kesselman, Brantly Stockinger LLP. But US regulators have begun to view companies with complementary services as also being problematic, said Garcia, who formerly served as deputy attorney general for the California Justice Department. The legal stakes are especially high for Google amid predictions that AI tools will take over some of the functions of search engines. Market research firm Gartner estimated last year that traditional search engine volume would drop 25% by 2026 as consumers gravitate towards AI tools. An Apple executive said in his courtroom testimony during this week\u2019s hearings that Google search queries on Apple devices have decreased, according to Bloomberg. (Google said in a statement on Wednesday that it \u201ccontinues to see overall query growth in search.\u201d) And OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT poses stiff competition; Google\u2019s Gemini is roughly 10% of ChatGPT\u2019s size on most user growth metrics, analysts at Barclays wrote in a research note from April 24. \u201cThe question is, will AI solutions give us better products?\u201d Siegel said. \u201cAnd that might cause people to switch and move away over time.\u201d",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gkvp6438ko",
      "content": "US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting tariffs on goods from China, in his latest comment to signal interest in de-escalating the trade war between the world's two biggest economies. \"80% Tariff on China seems right,\" Trump wrote on social media on Friday, ahead of trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying also struck a confident note ahead of the meetings, saying Beijing had \"full confidence\" in its ability to manage trade issues with the US. Since April, Trump has hit items from China with import taxes of 145%, sending shockwaves through financial markets and driving down trade between the two countries. On Friday, official figures for April showed China's exports to the US fell by more than 20% compared to a year earlier. But at the same time its total exports rose by a better-than-expected 8.1%. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are \"under growing economic pressure\", Dan Wang from political risk consultancy Eurasia Group told the BBC. \"The recent signals from both sides suggest a transactional de-escalation is on the table\", she added. The announcement earlier this week of the talks was welcomed as an important first step towards easing tensions but analysts have warned that this marks the start of what are likely to be lengthy negotiations. \"The systemic frictions between the US and China will not be resolved any time soon,\" said former US trade negotiator, Stephen Olson. Any cuts to tariffs as a result of this meeting are likely to be \"minor\", he added. The initial negotiations will be led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier and economic tsar He Lifeng. But \"I think everyone recognises that any final deal will require the active engagement of both presidents,\" Mr Olson said. Another trade expert said that even if the new tariffs imposed by Trump were lifted, the two countries would still have major issues to overcome. \"A realistic goal is probably at best a pullback from the sky-high bilateral tariffs but that would still leave in place high tariff barriers and various other restrictions\", the former head of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) China division, Eswar Prasad told BBC News. On social media on Friday, Trump called on China to \"open up its market\" to the US. He said any tariff reduction would be \"up to Scott B\". In earlier remarks on Thursday, he had said he expected a \"very friendly\" meeting. The talks between China and the US are set to take place just two days after the UK became the first country to strike a tariffs deal with the Trump administration. The US agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, in exchange for new access to US beef and other exports, according to an outline of the new agreement. Countries around the world are scrambling to make similar deals before steep US import taxes are due to take effect next month. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries in April but paused them shortly afterwards for 90 days to give their governments time to negotiate with his administration. Businesses based in the US will also be watching events in Switzerland closely. Wild Rye, a women's outdoor clothing firm based in the state of Idaho, has manufacturing stations in China and has been severely affected by the tariffs. The cost of shipping goods has jumped significantly, the firm's chief executive, Cassie Abel, told the BBC's Today programme. \"We have a purchase order that's incoming, which is around $700,000 [of goods] that's now costing \u00a31.2m in levies up from \u00a3200,000,\" she said. Ms Abel added she was now looking to sell parts of her business to try to raise cash.

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yk5nj7p7ko",
      "content": "Mexico is suing Google for ignoring repeated requests not to call the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America on Google Maps for US users, President Claudia Sheinbaum says. She did not say where the lawsuit had been filed. Google did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. On Thursday, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to officially rename the Gulf for federal agencies. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office in January. He argued the change was justified because the US \"do most of the work there, and it's ours\". However Sheinbaum's government contends that Trump's order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf. \"All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,\" she said, asserting that the US lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf. In January, Sheinbaum wrote a letter to Google asking the firm to reconsider its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico for US users. The following month, she threatened legal action. At the time, Google said it made the change as part of \"a longstanding practice\" of following name changes when updated by official government sources. It said the Gulf - which is bordered by the US, Cuba and Mexico - would not be changed for people using the app in Mexico, and users elsewhere in the world will see the label: \"Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)\". The Associated Press (AP) news agency's refusal to start referring to the Gulf of America led to a months-long conflict with the White House, which restricted AP's access to certain events. A federal judge ordered the White House in April to stop sidelining the outlet. Trump hinted Wednesday that he may recommend changing the way the US refers to another body of water. During an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, he plans to announce that the US will henceforth refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, AP reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has responded by saying he hopes the \"absurd rumours\" are \"no more than a disinformation campaign\" and such a move would \"bring the wrath of all Iranians\".",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp92r2kvk74o",
      "content": "The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, as part of a new agreement between the US and UK. The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January. But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK. Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year. No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details. Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\". \"This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,\" he said, adding that the \"the UK has no greater ally than the United States\". At the White House, Trump called it a \"great deal\" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance. \"This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,\" he said.  The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year. That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs. \"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\" Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously. The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative. The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes. Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products. \"It can't be understated how important this deal is,\" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said. UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer \"major relief\" to the steel sector. \"The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,\" he said. Other business groups expressed more uncertainty. \"It's better\u00a0than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,\" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade. \"I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit.\" While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US. \"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\" The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say. Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail. \"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\" Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a \"step in the right direction\". He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development. \"The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,\" he said. \"It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.\"  The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time. But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK. It was not clear how much those issues had advanced. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a \"tremendous win\" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes. The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports. While the UK appears to have made some commitments, \"the devil will be in the details,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement. Other issues loom. Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines. The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms \"preferential treatment\". But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now \"left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean\".",

      "content": "The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US. But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. Here's an at-a-glance look at what's in the deal. Trump declared on social media this announcement would be a \"major trade deal\" - it's not. He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress. Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on some of Trump's tariffs. This is an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods. It is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement, there will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow. Trump had placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US on top of the existing 2.5%. This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year. But any cars exported above that quota will be subject to a 27.5% import tax. Cars are the UK's biggest export to the US - worth about \u00a39bn last year. Jaguar Land Rover, which exports almost a quarter of its cars to the US,  said the deal \"secures greater certainty for our sector\". But car industry leaders have told the BBC the quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively. The UK currently imposes a 10% levy on US car imports, but it is not clear if there is any change to this. The US has previously demanded the tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves had indicated she is open to such a cut. Trump also announced that Rolls-Royce engines and plane parts will be able to be exported from the UK to the US tariff-free. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US that came into effect in March has been scrapped. This is good news for firms such as British Steel which was brought under government control as it struggled to stay operational. However, the White House said it would impose a quota on the \"most favoured nation rates for UK steel and aluminium and certain derivative steel and aluminium products.\" It is currently unclear how much of these products the UK will be able to export to the US under this quota system without paying more. It is also unclear whether the scrapping of tariffs will apply to steel derivative products and whether only steel melted and poured in the UK will benefit. The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, about \u00a3700m in total. However, the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, including things such as gym equipment, furniture and machinery. These are worth much more, about \u00a32.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year. Industry body Steel UK said there were \"a number hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal\". It said firms needed to know what supply chain conditions need to be met, what the quotas are and when they take effect. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs. The US said both countries would \"promptly negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals\". Pharmaceuticals are a major export for the UK when it comes to US trade \u2013 last year sales of these products were worth \u00a36.6bn making it the UK's second-biggest export to the US. It's also America's fourth biggest export to the UK, valued at \u00a34bn last year. Most countries, including the US, imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, as part of an agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable. The president has not announced any trade restrictions on medicines yet. There was no change to the UK's 2% digital services tax in this deal and it appears to be a sticking point. Businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces have to pay it if they receive more than \u00a3500m in global revenues and \u00a325m from UK users annually. But this threshold is easily met by US tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple. The UK reportedly netted nearly \u00a3360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year. The UK government said it had \"agreed to work on a digital trade deal\". But the US government said it was \"disappointed that the UK was unwilling to agree to fully address the tax. \"It is discriminatory, unjustified, and should be removed promptly,\" it said. US beef exports to the UK had been subject to a 20% tariff within a quota of 1,000 metric tons. The UK has scrapped this tariff and raised the quota to 13,000 metric tonnes, according to the White House document. In return, the UK has been given the same quota at a lower rate in line with other countries. Crucially, there will be no weakening of UK food standards on imports as part of this deal, the UK government statement said, insisting that American hormone-treated meat will not seep onto the UK market. Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s. The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones. This is an area where the UK has chosen alignment with EU - and the forthcoming \"Brexit reset\" with the EU - over the US. The tariff on ethanol coming into the UK from the US has also been scrapped. The National Farmers Union said the inclusion of \"a significant volume of bioethanol [a renewable fuel made from crops] in the deal raises concerns for British arable farmers\".",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89pw3j7z9zo",
      "content": "The government has insisted that American hormone-treated meat will not start to seep into the UK market, following the tariff deal agreed this week that boosts the trade in beef in both directions. Some farmers and consumers have expressed fears that the deal could open the door to beef from cattle raised using hormones to boost their growth. However, the government said certification procedures and border checks would ensure hormone-reared beef would not enter the UK. The National Farmers' Union said it was asking the government to provide more details on how checks would work to ensure safety standards were maintained. \"The rules on food standards have not changed and they will not change as a result of the deal,\" said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones. He added that the agencies responsible for border safety checks would be able to test meat for traces of hormone with \"consequences\" for anyone breaking the law. But Ian McCubbine, a beef farmer in Surrey, said he was concerned about the prospect of more American-grown beef coming into the UK. \"How do we know what they are putting in?\" he said, speaking to the BBC's Today programme. \"We spent 50 years building an industry that is strong on environmental gain and animal welfare. \"The concern is that the US [beef imports] could be of lower quality.\" The UK stopped allowing hormone-produced beef in 1989, when the practice was banned across the EU after it declared it unsafe. But many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production. Adding growth hormones makes cows put on muscle mass, and so makes their beef cheaper. The US and other countries that use the method, including Australia, say there is no added health-risk from hormone-treated beef. However, a lot of consumers are wary of it, with some commenting online that they would look out for UK-produced beef in future. As part of the tariff deal the UK has agreed to allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free. That is the equivalent of one medium-sized steak per adult per year. Currently the US exports around 1,000 tonnes to the UK with a 20% tariff, the UK's Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. In exchange, the UK will also be able to sell more beef to the US than it currently does, also up to 13,000 tonnes at a lower tariff than at present. The deal also includes lower tariffs on UK-made cars destined for the US market and US ethanol exports to the UK. Liz Webster, founder of the group Save British Farming, echoed Mr McCubbine's fears in a post on X. \"In exchange for tariff relief on luxury cars, we've opened our doors to US beef and ethanol. But as our border checks are barely functioning, how we'll enforce standards is anyone's guess,\" she wrote. Some X users suggested shoppers should look out for the Red Tractor label, which means meat is produced in the UK. \"I'll be buying from my local butchers who knows the local farmers and which herds the beef comes from,\" said one. US producers must have monitoring and certification procedures in place to prove that they are compliant with UK food standards to be allowed to export, Defra said. Hormones are usually used to fatten cattle in the later stages of production, a Defra spokesperson said, and therefore traces would be identifiable through checks.",

      "content": "The Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development in Zimbabwe has issued an apology after it posted incorrect information on social media, falsely claiming that contractors were already on site for the Victoria Falls Road project. The apology came after social media users, including investigative journalist Hopewell Chin\u2019ono, accused the government of corruption in the tender process. \u201cThe Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development wishes to unreservedly apologise to members of the public and all its stakeholders,\u201d read a statement posted on 29 April 2025. The original tweet, published at 9:18am on 29 April, stated that \u201call eight contractors involved in the project are now on site.\u201d But this claim was false \u2014 the tender process had not even closed at the time. Hopewell Chin\u2019ono reacted strongly to the false claim on X (formerly Twitter), saying the government had exposed itself. \u201cThey floated a tender for the repair of the Bulawayo\u2013Victoria Falls Road, and the closing date for this tender process is today, 29 April 2025,\u201d he posted. \u201cYet\u2026 the Ministry of Transport\u2019s Twitter handle [says] all the contractors are already on site.\u201d Chin\u2019ono said this could only mean one thing: \u201cMnangagwa gave the tender to his cronies in exchange for kickbacks and bribes!\u201d He went further, suggesting there may be whistleblowers inside the Ministry: \u201cPerhaps tweeting this is a deliberate move by progressive people inside the regime who are fed up with Mnangagwa\u2019s shameless public procurement criminal cartels.\u201d In a formal retraction issued later the same day, Permanent Secretary Eng. P.J. Makumbe clarified the actual state of affairs. \u201cThe Ministry acknowledges that no contractor is on site, as the tender process is still ongoing.\u201d The Ministry explained that the tweet was posted without verification from technical officials: \u201cOne of the officers\u2026 acknowledged that she breached the internal Standard Operating Procedures of information verification.\u201d The tender, issued on 17 April, closed at 11:00am on 29 April 2025. According to the Ministry: \u201cAn evaluation committee will sit, whereupon the outcome will be sent to the Special Procurement Oversight Committee before awarding the same to successful bidders.\u201d Despite the mix-up, the Ministry stressed its commitment to transparency: \u201cThe Ministry remains committed to the need for sharing correct information to members of the public.\u201d Follow Us on Google News for Immediate Updates",

      "content": "RBZ Hands Out US$10 Million to 135 Companies Through Targeted Finance Facility The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has pumped ZiG300 million (around US$10 million) into the economy through a special funding facility aimed at boosting key industries. Since January, 135 private sector companies have benefited from the initiative, which offers affordable loans to support economic growth. According to RBZ data, the agriculture sector was the biggest winner, with 60 companies accessing funds from the Targeted Finance Facility (TFF). The manufacturing sector wasn\u2019t far behind, with 53 companies benefiting. Meanwhile, 18 firms in the wholesale and retail space also got a slice of the funding, and the construction and energy sectors saw four companies each receive support. RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu explained that agriculture and manufacturing were prioritised because of their crucial role in driving Zimbabwe\u2019s economic growth. \u201cIn line with the facility objectives, the manufacturing and agriculture sectors received the biggest share of the funding, given their significant contribution to domestic production. An analysis of historical growth trends of the Zimbabwe economy shows that strong recovery in agriculture and manufacturing production has had significant positive impacts on the economy,\u201d Dr Mushayavanhu said. Also read:\u00a0\u2018We no longer need the black market\u2019: Why Zimbabwean Manufacturers Are Now Turning Away From Parallel Forex Dealers The TFF, launched by the RBZ at the start of 2025, is designed to boost the economy without causing inflation. It does this by offering low-interest loans to productive industries, while keeping the country\u2019s tight monetary policy intact. Under the TFF, banks borrow money from the central bank at 20% interest and are allowed to on-lend to businesses at a maximum rate of 30%. Loans are short-term, with a maximum repayment period of 270 days. Borrowers can take out and repay loans in ZiG or foreign currency at the current exchange rate. Dr Mushayavanhu expressed satisfaction with how the facility is working. \u201cOverall, the TFF has enabled the Reserve Bank to make available targeted liquidity to the productive sectors of the economy, while maintaining its current tight monetary policy stance, aimed at durably reducing inflation to low and sustainable levels,\u201d he added. Speaking virtually at the ZITF 2025 International Business Conference last week, Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube assured businesses that government will continue to tighten the screws to make sure the TFF stays effective and truly benefits the economy.

      "content": " Zimbabwe\u2019s presidential spokesperson George Charamba has revealed why some Black farmers lost land during the country\u2019s controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme under former President Robert Mugabe in the early 2000s. Writing on the social media platform X, Charamba explained that some Black farmers were used by white farmers to try and protect their land from government takeover. \u201cAt the height of Fast Track Land Reforms, a number of black Zimbabweans became parapets behind whom hid several white farmers who sought to deflect and defeat the programme,\u201d wrote Charamba under his X handle @Jamwanda2. \u201cIn short, white farmers would \u2018transfer\u2019 their farms to those blacks in the hope of saving the farms from acquisition.\u201d Charamba\u2019s post came in response to prominent lawyer and businessman Tawanda Nyambirai\u2019s claim that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had personally intervened to restore land to him and other Black Zimbabweans who lost their farms under the first republic. Tawanda Nyambirai revealed that he lost his land because of political abuse of the system by powerful figures. \u201cIn my case, it was the late General Mujuru who abused the system and targeted me,\u201d Nyambirai wrote. \u201cHis main target was Mr Strive Masiyiwa as was later explained to me by the former First Family\u2026 When HE discovered that the situation was too dangerous for me after my brothers were kidnapped, he advised me to vacate the farms and wait for sanity to prevail before vindicating my rights.\u201d Nyambirai said he was eventually helped by the late Vice President Msika and Chester Mhende. He added that President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was the speaker of Parliament then,\u00a0 was supportive and had even advised him to step aside temporarily to avoid violence. Nyambirai confirmed that he followed all the legal steps to reclaim his farms. He said the land was restored after 20 years, thanks to direct intervention from President Mnangagwa. \u201cUpon being reminded that I lost my farms under the First Republic, the President directed that my farms be restored,\u201d he said. \u201cI followed the prescribed legal process and indeed the title to my farms was restored after 20 years. We are now in the final stages of taking back possession.\u201d Nyambirai also mentioned that the group he belongs to includes other Black farmers who held land through companies. Charamba responded by thanking Nyambirai for clarifying the history. \u201cThank you for clarifying matters for the sake of truth and history. Kune vanga voshandisa your case to badmouth Land Reforms. Anyway, justice was restored and we are happy for you and your family,\u201d Charamba posted. He added that not all land losses were the same. \u201cI would never put landless blacks as a population in the same group with Rhodesian landed gentry, thereby creating a false impression their SCARS were comparable,\u201d Charamba said. He concluded by noting that Zimbabwe\u2019s land issue continues to draw global interest. \u201cIt\u2019s not fortuitous that the Zim land issue is being revisited now when Trump has pronounced himself on SA\u2019s racist land policies,\u201d he said.

My Senior Brother, Nic Vingirai was also assisted. We have an association of black indigenous farmers who lost land. We are all grateful that the Government, especially the President himself, has stepped forward to give us redress.\u201d Nyambirai revealed that an organised group of black indigenous farmers who had lost their land had formed an association to engage the government and navigate the legal process. When asked if the group included companies that lost land during the programme, he replied: \u201cSome members of the group held their farms through their companies.\u201d He stressed the importance of acknowledging progress, saying: \u201cWe must always give credit where it is due.\u201d Presidential spokesperson George Charamba responded positively to the news, thanking Nyambirai for shedding light on the issue. \u201cThank you for clarifying matters for the sake of truth and history.

His main target was Mr Strive Masiyiwa, as was later explained to me by the former First Family,\u201d he revealed. Nyambirai explained that President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was the speaker of Parliament at the time,\u00a0 had tried to help but ultimately advised him to leave his farm for safety after his brothers were kidnapped. \u201cHE [President Emmerson Mnangagwa] did his best to assist me after he was requested to help me by the late VP Msika and by a dear friend, Mr Chester Mhende. \u201cWhen HE discovered that the situation was too dangerous for me after my brothers were kidnapped, he advised me to vacate the farms and wait for sanity to prevail before vindicating my rights. \u201cHE was for land reform, but not for the violence. HE always believed that some cases deserved compensation and that land must have title.\u201d He also mentioned that Mnangagwa had played a behind-the-scenes role in trying to assist. \u201cI was privileged to know the side of HE that is hidden to many. If I was better at making friends, I would have had the privilege of being closer to him.\u201d The restoration comes nearly 20 years after the farms were seized. \u201cJustice was restored,\u201d Charamba concluded in his reply.

      "content": "I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Digitising NHS and social care will cost \u00a321 billion over the next five years, but could be vital for driving down waiting lists, according to new research. A report said the UK will need to spend billions to fully implement electronic patient records, cloud storage, cyber security and wi-fi, with the skills and capabilities needed to use them. The Health Foundation charity commissioned PA Consulting ahead of the forthcoming Government spending review, and publication of the 10-year health plan, to estimate the costs of making the transformation to digital services. The Government has pledged to move the health service from analogue to digital as part of its \u201cthree shifts\u201d for the NHS, which also include moving care from hospitals to communities and preventing sickness. In the new report, estimates suggest that \u00a38 billion of capital spending (of which \u00a35 billion is for England) is needed for things like hardware, software and electronic patient records. A further \u00a33 billion would be one-off revenue spending (of which \u00a32.25 billion is for England), for planning, initial education and training, implementation of new technologies and transition from old systems. Some \u00a32 billion recurring annual spending (of which \u00a31.5 billion per year is for England) over five years is also needed for ongoing training, software subscriptions, maintenance, improvement and optimisation. Recurring costs will then carry on beyond the five-year period. According to the Health Foundation, while it may be possible to cover some of the costs from existing budgets, it is highly likely the Government will need to commit additional funding. Tom Hardie, senior improvement fellow at the Health Foundation, said: \u201cDigitisation is going to be really critical for the NHS and social care to be sustainable and fit for the 21st century. \u201cWhen we talk about waiting times in particular, I think there are hopes that digitisation could help to address waiting times. \u201cWithin this research, we haven\u2019t set out to define or quantify the benefits of digitisation, but I think it\u2019s possible to say that digitisation could theoretically help to reduce waiting times. \u201cSo, for example, making it easier and simpler for people to get appointments or to cancel and rebook appointments. \u201cIt could help to optimise (operating) theatre schedules, improve prevention of acute episodes of care through remote monitoring of people with health conditions, improved triage processes to help direct people to the right services first time (and) perhaps avoiding more resource-intensive services like A&E.\u201d Making the NHS more digitally capable will also free up staff time, he said. Figures suggest that medics lose more than 13.5 million hours a year because of inadequate or malfunctioning IT. Dr Malte Gerhold, director of innovation and improvement at the Health Foundation, said:\u00a0\u201cOur independently commissioned research finds that to achieve the Government\u2019s ambitions to digitise health and social care, significant spending will be needed over the next five years and beyond. \u201cBut direct investment in technology alone is not sufficient. \u201cThe Government must fund the change not just the tech. This means investing in and planning for implementation and change to genuinely realise the benefits of digitisation for patients and staff.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the private sector is 15 years ahead of the NHS on technology, adding: \u201cThis Government is bringing our analogue NHS into the digital age, to improve the productivity of the NHS, deliver better care for patients and better value for taxpayers. \u201cWe are already making significant progress by introducing cutting-edge AI and technology to support clinicians and improve care, reforming the NHS app to give patients more control, and centralising patient records to speed up diagnosis and treatment. \u201cThis is only possible because of the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance, which allowed us to invest an extra \u00a326 billion for health and social care.\u201d",

In a speech at the London Defence Conference on Thursday (8 May), the prime minister said: \"As you know, talks with the US have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today. \u201cBut make no mistake, I will always act in our national interest, for workers, businesses and families, to deliver security and renewal for our country.\" 00:48 00:26 01:39 01:55 10:44 07:06 07:42 08:21 17:10 06:38 09:22 05:39 04:42 04:46 06:17 05:14 07:54 06:29 07:27 05:23 02:03 03:22 02:15 02:22 02:21 01:43 01:42 01:45 10:44 03:44 07:42 09:22 06:11 07:50 06:21 02:19 05:49 05:45 04:13 03:58 04:06 03:41 04:08 04:10 03:51 04:18 06:26 04:30 03:35 03:45 07:34 08:19 10:42 06:27 07:23 06:35 12:18 11:50 09:03 13:07 07:25 04:31 07:30 03:34 03:18 03:21 03:28 04:57 00:16 00:26 00:39 00:42 01:00 00:59 04:00 00:42 00:49 00:33 01:00 00:31 00:54 01:08 01:35 00:47 00:42 00:23 19:48 00:35 00:40 04:36 00:28 00:16 01:00 01:02 00:57 00:23 00:36 01:33 02:30 00:50 03:29 03:07 03:07 03:24 01:36 00:42 01:26 00:32 00:31 02:00 00:40 00:58 04:23 04:26 01:01 01:07 15:55 16:33 16:06 15:01 15:16 01:16 00:36 00:48 01:08 01:12 01:23 01:24 Live 01:51 02:07 02:00 02:09 01:00:15 02:13 01:55 00:58",

      "content": "The Independent explains what tariffs are still hitting the UK despite trade deal with the US I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Donald Trump has unveiled a \"historic agreement\" with the UK, the culmination of Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s months-long charm offensive towards the US president. A month after his so-called Liberation Day tariffs began to bite, Britain has now achieved a series of significant carve-outs from sweeping tariffs on UK carmakers, steelworks and farmers. The deal is a major boost for the prime minister, coming hot on the heels of a trade agreement between the UK and India this week. Donald Trump said the agreement with the UK is a \u201cgreat deal for both countries\u201d, while Sir Keir said \u201cthis is a really fantastic, historic day\u201d as he spoke to the US president about the deal on the phone. Here, The Independent looks at how different sectors of Britain\u2019s economy will be affected. The deal, which the UK government has said will save \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d, will see car export tariffs slashed from 27.5 per cent to 10 per cent, for a quota of 100,000 UK cars. This, the government said, is almost the total the UK exported last year. The agreement is crucial as it will allow British carmakers to restart sales to the American market. Jaguar Land Rover had suspended US shipments in the wake of Mr Trump\u2019s \u2018Liberation Day\u2019 tariff announcements, and Sir Keir was keen to announce the trade deal at the company\u2019s Solihull manufacturing plant to offer reassurance to workers at the firm and across the sector. Mr Trump\u2019s 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium will be axed entirely, in a major boost for the beleaguered sector. The government last month took control of British Steel to prevent the closure of its Scunthorpe blast furnaces and hopes Thursday\u2019s trade deal will keep the sector alive. The two governments have negotiated new reciprocal market access on beef, giving UK farmers a tariff-free quota of 13,000 metric tonnes of meat. There are concerns that the new reciprocal market access on beef could lead to a decline in food standards. However, the UK government insisted that there will be \u201cno weakening of UK food standards on imports\u201d, amid concerns a deal could pave the way for the import of hormone-treated beef from the US. Donald Trump also played down concerns that it could open up UK markets to chlorine-washed chicken, saying the UK will \u201ctake what they want\u201d when it comes to US beef and chicken imports, rather than being forced to accept lower standards. US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins added: \u201cSpecific to the beef, this is going to exponentially increase our beef exports. And to be very clear, American beef is the safest, the best quality, and the crown jewel of American agriculture for the world.\u201d A consistent red line in negotiations has been food standards, amid fears a trade deal could open Britain\u2019s doors to hormone-injected beef and chlorinated chicken. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and chancellor Rachel Reeves have both ruled out lowering Britain's food standards to get a deal over the line, in a boost to struggling farmers. The government also failed to secure carve-outs for tariffs on pharmaceuticals and the remaining 10 per cent reciprocal tariffs imposed on Britain. The government said \u201cwork will continue\u201d on those. There have also been no concessions secured for the film and TV industry, after Mr Trump threatened to apply a 100 per cent levy on films made outside America, which the PM has been warned would devastate film and TV production in the UK. There were also concerns that the US was trying to win concessions on Britain\u2019s digital services tax, paid by overseas search engines and social media sites on revenues from the UK. But today\u2019s deal saw the tax left unchanged. A change to the tax would have been a boost to major American firms such as Amazon, Facebook owner Meta and Google owner Alphabet. Instead, the two nations have agreed to work on a digital trade deal that will strip back paperwork for British firms trying to export to the US - something the government said would open the UK up to a \u201chuge market that will put rocket boosters on the UK economy\u201d. Tariffs on ethanol, which Downing Street wrongly claimed is used to produce beer, have been removed entirely. In addition to this, Downing Street has also said that the US has agreed to give the UK \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d in any further tariffs imposed as part of Section 232 investigations - a process where the US government determines if certain imports threaten US national security.

      "content": "Vice-president JD Vance has said there is a \u2018good chance\u2019 a deal could be reached soon, but what are the red lines, and will it mean Britain can avoid tariffs? Alicja Hagopian, David Maddox and Archie Mitchell explain I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump are on the brink of announcing a new trade deal after nearly five years of negotiations. The previous government began discussions for a free trade agreement in May 2020 with then-president Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Now, Mr Trump has said \"major trade deal\" will be announced with a \"highly respected country\" on Thursday, widely believed to be a reference to the UK. Sir Keir's spokesman has promised an update from the prime minister on Thursday, too, all but confirming a deal has been done. While the UK initially received the lowest possible tariff rate under Mr Trump's trade war, with 10 per cent taxes applied on exports to the United States, it was later left at the same rate as the rest of the world. But Thursday's announcement confirms a coup for Sir Keir, with his fawning diplomatic approach to Mr Trump appearing to have paid off. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government has made no pretence over the fact that it is not looking for a traditional comprehensive trade deal. Instead, it is pushing for an agreement based around the growth of \u201cfuture\u201d industries, such as biotech, new pharmaceuticals and artificial intelligence. The proposal is that the UK and US research base, coupled with the money markets in New York and London, would create a powerhouse for the latest industrial revolution, which could shape the future of the world. The US largely embraces this idea, but there are caveats, and the negotiations have been complicated by President Trump\u2019s tariffs. While a final deal would see close integration for those future growth industries, it now would also mean deals on more traditional areas to remove tariffs altogether. The biggest issue \u2013 as is often the case \u2013 will be how far it affects agricultural products. Mr Trump\u2019s team would like the UK to allow chlorinated chicken or beef with added hormones. But the UK does not want to go this far. There could also be demands for the UK to repeal legislation on tech controls, which the White House says affects free speech. In the end, the quick deal will be closer to the UK vision on future growth technologies, but the ongoing question is how much Sir Keir will have to compromise in other areas. The US continues to be Britain\u2019s largest single-country trading partner, followed by Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and France. As a bloc, trade with the EU is significantly higher. The UK has nearly no trade imbalance with the US when it comes to goods, exporting \u00a359.3bn and importing \u00a357.2bn in 2024. This has likely contributed to the fact that Britain has not been in Mr Trump\u2019s firing range when it comes to extra tariffs \u2013 and why a trade deal is on the cards. Currently, the UK is facing a 10 per cent tariff on all goods exported to the US. British automotive and steel exports are taking a stronger blow, with a separate 25 per cent levy on sales to the US market. Cars are Britain\u2019s single largest export to the US, valued at \u00a38.3bn in the year up to November 2024. The US is also the top buyer of domestic cars, from Aston Martin to Mini; though British brand Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is the most at risk from tariffs, with the US being its top sales market. This has been a point of tension between Sir Keir and Mr Trump, as negotiations to exempt the UK from these industry-specific tariffs have so far fallen short. Other industrial exports are also high on the list, with \u00a35.3bn in mechanical power generators and \u00a32.3bn in aircraft sent to the US last year. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s health and scientific industries are also reliant on the US market. The UK sent vaccines, medicines and other pharmaceutical products worth \u00a37.3bn to the US last year, and \u00a32.4bn in scientific instruments like microscopes and X-ray equipment. Britain buys billions in medical and pharmaceutical products from the US, too, meaning that both industries are significantly intertwined, with health secretary Wes Streeting warning that tariffs could pose challenges. The UK only imports around \u00a3100m in animal products from the US, a point of contention for Mr Trump, who has urged Britons to buy more chlorinated and hormone-treated animal products such as beef and chicken. Meanwhile, crude oil is Britain\u2019s leading import from the US, at \u00a38.6bn in the 12 months up to November 2024. President Trump has suggested in the past that buying more American oil and gas could be a way to curry favour in the global trade war. Services are perhaps the most significant element of UK-US trade, representing some \u00a3179bn in services exchanged between the two countries. The UK benefits from an open relationship with the US, exporting twice as many services (\u00a3124bn) as it imports (\u00a355bn). This includes \u00a352.3bn across various business services, \u00a327.8bn in financial services, and \u00a311bn in insurance and pensions. Perhaps most importantly, with regards to the new trade deal, the UK exports \u00a310.3bn in telecoms, tech and IT services across the pond \u2013 and imported \u00a33.5bn last year. The tech industry \u2013 in particular AI, biotech and quantum \u2013 is on the agenda for UK-US negotiations, as both sides seek to deepen their ties in so-called \u201cfuture industries\u201d. On a visit to California last month, UK technology secretary Peter Kyle met with US tech leaders, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Nvidia, touting Britain as a global hub for AI investment. Both countries have been aligned on tech for some time and have expressed their intentions to steamroll ahead on AI. In February, both the UK and the US refused to sign an international agreement on AI, which aimed to make development \u201copen\u201d, \u201cinclusive\u201d, and \u201cethical\u201d. While the UK cited national security concerns, the US said that overregulation would \u201ckill a transformative industry\u201d. Less than one year earlier, both countries \u2013 under different governments \u2013 had announced a partnership on AI safety.

      "content": "President Donald Trump said he\u2019s open to hiking taxes on wealthy Americans to help pay for Republicans\u2019 sweeping tax and spending cuts package, but the idea remains hotly contested among GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In a Truth Social post Friday morning, Trump said that he would \u201cgraciously accept\u201d even a \u201cTINY\u201d tax increase on the rich, while acknowledging that that it could bring political risks for Republicans. House GOP lawmakers have been struggling to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to help offset trillions of dollars of tax reductions. \u201cThe problem with even a \u2018TINY\u2019 tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, \u2018Read my lips,\u2019 the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIn any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I\u2019m OK if they do!!!\u201d he continued. Trump also mentioned the possibility of letting tax cuts expire on top earners \u2013 targeting individuals who earn at least $2.5 million or couples that make at least $5 million \u2014 in a call with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, a Republican source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. The White House has made the suggestion to Congress with the thought that not only would it help achieve much needed offsets, it could also help wipe away Democrats\u2019 argument about tax cuts for the rich, the source familiar said. This is not the first time Trump has indicated that he supports raising taxes on the wealthy, even though throughout last year\u2019s presidential campaign, he repeatedly promised to cut their taxes. The president recently told Time magazine, \u201cI actually love the concept,\u201d when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $1 million a year. The idea, however, is not being warmly embraced among the House GOP and is far from guaranteed to make it into the president\u2019s final \u201cone big beautiful\u201d bill, which aims to make permanent the sweeping Trump 2017 tax cuts and incorporate the president\u2019s campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and certain other income. Just extending the 2017 individual tax provisions \u2013 which expire at the end of this year \u2013 could cost more than $4 trillion. Republican lawmakers are also fractured on how deeply they\u2019d have to cut spending \u2013 including on Medicaid and food stamps \u2013 to meet their targets. Within the House Ways and Means Committee, members have discussed two ideas. One is to let the tax breaks for the richest Americans expire, returning their top income tax rate to 39.6% \u2013 which is what it was before Trump\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul \u2013 from the current 37%. This has drawn some criticism, however, as some Republicans fear it could impact small business owners. But it could hit roughly 1.5 million households and cut about $409 billion of the cost, as well as greatly limit potential economic growth from making the tax cuts permanent, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank. Another idea is to create a brand-new tax bracket for the wealthy. The proposal, though limited in scope, could contribute to offsetting costly tax provisions, such as restoring the state and local tax deduction \u2013 known as SALT \u2013 that has become another flashpoint in Congress\u2019 tax debate. The new tax bracket would raise about $59.3 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. And it would affect between 150,000 and 200,000 households and would have a much smaller dampening effect on the package\u2019s economic growth potential. Levying a higher income tax rate on the very wealthiest of Americans would raise less money because much of that group\u2019s earnings come from dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates, said Garrett Watson, the foundation\u2019s director of policy analysis. Also, there are much fewer of them. One of the considerations for Republicans is what the goal of such a provision would be \u2013 to limit how much of the benefit is going to the rich or to raise more money to offset other tax cuts, Watson said. Despite Trump\u2019s apparent openness to raising taxes on the wealthy, his economic adviser said Friday that the president \u201cis not a strong advocate\u201d of the idea. Asked whether Trump is seriously considering taxing the rich to pay for his budget bill, National Economic Director Kevin Hassett said: \u201cThe president is not a strong advocate of that, but he is a strong advocate of many things like no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and nice treatment for auto loans.\u201d \u201cHe has cited his priorities, and he understands that in the end, the final bill will include some priorities of members of the House of the Senate. That\u2019s how the democratic process works, and that\u2019s really what this conversation is about.\u201d Trump reaffirmed Friday evening, however, that he\u2019s open to taxing rich Americans, calling it \u201cgood politics.\u201d A reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office what his message would be to conservative Republicans who warn it\u2019s a tax increase on small business owners. Trump cast it as a \u201credistribution.\u201d \u201cPeople would love to do it \u2014 rich people. I would love to do it, frankly,\u201d the president said. When asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill, given a number of its stated priorities are expensive, Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts, without detailing what they are and whether they are achievable. \u201cWell, the budget rules in the House and the Senate are very clearly identified that include spending cuts and so on, and they don\u2019t include dynamic scores,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd so in the fullest of time with the spending cuts that we\u2019re achieving ,and the dynamic score of the tax bill, we\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019re going to reduce the deficit that make bond markets celebrate.\u201d Hassett has been meeting almost weekly with Johnson, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others regarding Congress\u2019 budget. Earlier this week, the group met in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report.",

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/treasury-debt-ceiling-x-date",
      "content": "Lawmakers have until August to address the debt ceiling or the US could default on its obligations for the first time ever, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote to congressional leaders Friday, urging them to act even sooner, \u201cto protect the full faith and credit of the United States.\u201d The projection gives Republican lawmakers \u2013 who control Capitol Hill \u2013 a firmer deadline of when they have to pass their massive budget reconciliation bill, which aims to increase the debt ceiling along with extending the 2017 tax cuts and slashing federal spending. In his letter, Bessent said there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the cash and extraordinary measures that are allowing Treasury to continue paying the nation\u2019s bills in full and on time will be exhausted in August, pointing out that is when Congress is scheduled to be in recess. But he noted that the projection is subject to \u201csignificant uncertainty.\u201d \u201cTherefore, I respectfully urge Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July, before its scheduled break, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\u201d he wrote. Treasury has been using cash and extraordinary measures to pay the nation\u2019s bills in full and on time since January 21, when the US hit its roughly $36 trillion debt ceiling. Once the nation reaches that cap, which it has done repeatedly, it can no longer borrow to cover its obligations in full and on time. A default would likely cause global economic upheaval. House GOP leaders are closely monitoring projections for the so-called X-date, when the government could default, House Speaker Mike Johnson said at an Axios event in late April. \u201cThat\u2019s a big pressure point, and we don\u2019t know exactly when that X date will fall,\u201d Johnson said, noting at the time that he was working under the assumption it could be as early as the beginning of June. \u201cWe can\u2019t be caught flat-footed on this.\u201d However, the caucus remains divided over how to address all three of its goals in the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d leaving leaders with the tricky task of constructing a package that can get enough GOP votes to pass both chambers. In March, Bessent told lawmakers that he would continue using extraordinary measures \u2013 which are largely behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers \u2013 through June 27. The Congressional Budget Office in March projected that the \u201cX-date\u201d would be reached in August or September. Though they control Congress, Republicans are divided over how to handle the debt ceiling. The House has included a $4 trillion increase to the cap in its budget resolution, while the Senate version raises the limit by $5 trillion. President Donald Trump has pushed GOP lawmakers to address the limit as soon as possible.",

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/souter-supreme-court-dies",
      "content": "Former Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a Republican appointee who retired from the high court in 2009 after voting consistently with its liberal wing, has died, the Supreme Court announced on Friday. He was 85 years old. Souter, a low-key New Englander who eschewed the national spotlight, was known by some as the \u201cstealth nominee\u201d when President George H.W. Bush nominated him in 1990 to replace the liberal lion William Brennan. Advisers assured the president that Souter would move the court to the right \u2013 a misreading that continues to reverberate today. The Supreme Court said Souter died \u201cpeacefully\u201d on Thursday at his home in New Hampshire, but did not disclose the cause. \u201cJustice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly twenty years,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. \u201cHe brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service.\u201d Measured, scholarly and faithful to the idea of judicial restraint, those who knew Souter said his approach to the law shouldn\u2019t have surprised anyone who was paying close attention. \u201cThe whole point of it was that it was a Constitution and a Bill of Rights for the indefinite future,\u201d Souter said during a 2012 event. \u201cThe application of these values, the problem of trying to make them work in practice, was an assignment that was left to the future.\u201d It did not take conservatives long to regret Souter\u2019s nomination. After less than two years on the bench, he helped orchestrate a significant opinion that upheld the central tenet of Roe v. Wade, that the right to abortion was implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution. It wasn\u2019t until 2022 \u2013 three decades later \u2013 that the court ultimately overturned Roe. And he would go on to side with the court\u2019s liberal bloc in cases dealing with civil rights, affirmative action and voting. His tenure inspired a rallying cry on the right \u2013 \u201cNo More Souters\u201d \u2013 and led to a more rigorous ideological vetting of candidates. Subsequent nominees from both parties \u2013 including today\u2019s justices \u2013 are less likely to break with the party that appointed them. Justice Clarence Thomas, who joined the court about a year after Souter, remembered him as a \u201cwonderful colleague\u201d who was \u201ckind, honorable, and decent,\u201d in a statement released by the Supreme Court on Friday. Justice Samuel Alito, who also overlapped with Souter, said he was impressed with his \u201clearning, his dedication to the law, and his delightfully old-fashioned ways.\u201d \u201cI was very sorry to see him retire, but he sorely missed his native New Hampshire and his book-laden home there, and I was happy that he was able to spend the last 16 years of his life in the surroundings he cherished living the kind of private life he preferred,\u201d Alito said a statement released by the court. \u201cDavid Souter was a unique man with a special kindness and grace. He joined the court purely out of a sense of duty to the country,\u201d said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who replaced Souter on the bench after he retired in 2009. Attorney General Pam Bondi described Souter in a social media post Friday as a \u201cbrilliant man who devoted his life to public service and our courts.\u201d Souter wrote a widely cited First Amendment unanimous opinion in 1995 that permitted organizers of a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade in Boston to deny a place for an LGBTQ group. A decade later, he wrote for a 5-4 majority finding that three counties in Kentucky had violated the Frist Amendment when they displayed framed copies of the Ten Commandments in courthouses and public schools. \u201cThe divisiveness of religion in current public life is inescapable,\u201d Souter wrote. \u201cThis is no time to deny the prudence of understanding the establishment clause to require the government to stay neutral on religious belief, which is reserved for the conscience of the individual.\u201d He was often understated in his opinions. In a 2009 concurrence in a case involving Navajo Nation mineral rights, Souter put down only two sentences. \u201cI am not through regretting that my position\u201d in an early case \u201cdid not carry the day,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it did not, and I agree that the precedent of that case calls for the result reached here.\u201d In another break with today\u2019s norms, Souter stepped down after 19 years on the Supreme Court, seeking a return to his contemplative life in New Hampshire. Never married and never fond of the Washington social scene, Souter was only 69 when he stepped down \u2013 far younger than most departing justices. His retirement gave President Barack Obama, a Democrat, his first chance to name a Supreme Court justice. Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, a self-described \u201cfiery Latina\u201d to fill the shoes of the low-key New England native Souter. Today, Sotomayor is the senior member of the court\u2019s three-justice liberal bloc. Souter, happy to leave the politics and agitation of Washington behind, spent his retirement in New Hampshire, often sitting on lower courts to fill a vacancy when necessary.\u202fHis preference for a quieter life was evident during his time at the Supreme Court where he spurned technology and wrote his opinions in longhand. Asked if there would ever be cameras in the courtroom, he famously said, \u201cover my dead body.\u201d A stinging defeat for Souter was the 2000 decision Bush v. Gore that cleared the way for Bush\u2019s presidency. \u201cHe was very aggrieved\u201d by the decision, said Ralph Neas, the founder for People for the American Way. \u201cHe believed it was the ultimate politicization of the Supreme Court.\u201d David Hackett Souter was born in Massachusetts in 1939 but he grew up and attended grade school in New Hampshire. His father was a banker and his mother was a store clerk. He spent the summers as a child in his grandparents\u2019 house in New Hampshire, and attended Harvard, Oxford and Harvard Law School. In 1976, Souter became New Hampshire\u2019s attorney general, taking over for Warren Rudman. Rudman, a centrist Republican, would go on to serve in the US Senate and become one of Souter\u2019s greatest champions. Despite stiff opposition from the NAACP and the National Organization for Women, Souter was confirmed 90-9 by the Senate. Douglas Kmiec, a lawyer who served in the Bush administration, said that Souter \u201cwas tabula rasa\u201d when he showed up on the bench and called him a \u201csurprise.\u201d \u201cThe law for him, unlike many of his conservative colleagues, was not an abstract set of rules totally divorced from its effect in the real world,\u201d said Peter Rubin a former law clerk. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just an intellectual puzzle for him.\u201d Some of his habits were idiosyncratic, especially for Washington.  Souter was known to be a charming guest, but he didn\u2019t go out much. Instead, he preferred solo pursuits like reading and hiking in the New Hampshire mountains. In 2016, at a joint appearance discussing the role of food at the Supreme Court, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sotomayor revealed his unusual lunch habit. \u201cMy dear colleague David Souter,\u201d Ginsburg said, with a hint of distaste, ate one thing for lunch most days: plain yogurt. \u201cI understood,\u201d Sotomayor said, \u201che had an apple.\u201d Yes, Ginsburg replied. Sotomayor added: \u201cHe ate the core.\u201d After retiring from the Supreme Court, Souter continued to occasionally hear cases on the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals. He also took part in civics education curriculum reform efforts in New Hampshire, the court said. \u201cHis depth of commitment to the rule of law, his reverence for the Constitution, his faith in the American legal tradition, and his deep respect for the profession of law had a profound influence on all of us who had the privilege of sitting with him,\u201d said 1st Circuit Chief Judge David Barron. In 2010, Souter set out his philosophy during a commencement speech at Harvard. \u201cWe want not only liberty, but equality as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThese paired desires of ours can clash, and when they do, a court is forced to choose between them, between one constitutional good and another one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court has to decide which of our approved desires has the better claim, right here, right now, and a court has to do more than read fairly when it makes this kind of choice.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

      "content": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff warned that if Sunday\u2019s talks with Iran are not productive, \u201cthen they won\u2019t continue and we\u2019ll have to take a different route.\u201d In an interview with Breitbart posted Friday, Witkoff said the US opted against holding another round of talks last week \u201cbecause we needed to get to certain understandings with\u201d Iran in order for discussions to be useful. \u201cHopefully this Sunday they will be productive. Hopefully that means they will continue those talks,\u201d he said. The talks in Oman on Sunday will only be high-level, suggesting that the two sides would discuss a broader framework for moving forward. A source familiar told CNN that the technical team, which negotiates on more granular aspects of a deal like sanctions relief, is not expected to attend. \u201cIt was appropriate to have the next round of talks at the principals level,\u201d the source said. Another source familiar said the discussions are expected to be both direct and indirect. In the interview with Breitbart, Witkoff described the US expectations for the talks in some of the greatest detail to date. \u201cAn enrichment program can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. That\u2019s our red line. No enrichment. That means dismantlement, it means no weaponization, and it means that Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan\u2014those are their three enrichment facilities\u2014have to be dismantled,\u201d he said. Iran has said it must be allowed to enrich uranium, that it\u2019s non-negotiable. \u201cIran has every right to possess the full nuclear fuel cycle,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is expected to meet Witkoff on Sunday, wrote on X a week ago. Similar to the negotiations with Russia, where the US has floated incentives to end the war in Ukraine, Witkoff hinted at similar incentives with Tehran. \u201cWe\u2019re inviting Iran to be a member of the league of nations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying to Iran: \u2018You can be a better nation. We can do business with you. We can have strategic relationships with you. But you can\u2019t be a provocateur.\u2019\u201d Witkoff said Iran has told the US it does not want a nuclear weapon \u2013 a position Tehran has long maintained. The special envoy said that the talks are focused exclusively on the nuclear issue, a change from the attempts of the first Trump administration to deal widely with Iran\u2019s aggressive actions in the region. \u201cDo we think they need to stop enabling Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and pulling back from being a provocateur? We do believe that. That\u2019s a secondary discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cDo we think that they should not be supplying weapons to people we consider to be our enemies? We believe that. But again, we don\u2019t want to confuse the nuclear discussion because that to us is the existential issue. That\u2019s the issue that needs to be solved today and quickly.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alex Marquardt contributed to this story.",

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/politics/pentagon-military-academies-review-books",
      "content": "The Pentagon has ordered all military academies to identify and remove books from their libraries that deal with issues such as race, gender ideology, and other \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d that are now considered \u201cincompatible with the department\u2019s core mission,\u201d according to a memo obtained by CNN. The memo, dated Friday, is signed by the acting deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness and also announces the creation of a temporary Academic Libraries Committee \u201ccomprised of knowledgeable leaders, educators, and library professionals\u201d from across the Defense Department who will help identify and \u201csequester\u201d the offending books for further review. The books must be identified and set aside for review by May 21, the memo says. The committee has already developed a list of search terms to help military leaders identify books that may need to be removed. The terms include: \u201cAffirmative action,\u201d \u201canti-racism,\u201d \u201callyship,\u201d \u201cdiversity in the workplace,\u201d \u201cgender transition,\u201d \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d and \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d according to an attachment to the memo. The establishment of a special committee to review books for removal across the military academies marks an escalation of the Defense Department\u2019s efforts to eliminate \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d content across the military. In a separate memo released on Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also said there will be \u201cno consideration of race, ethnicity, or sex\u201d in admissions to US military academies, which will focus admissions \u201cexclusively on merit.\u201d The memo ordered the service academies to rank candidates, starting with the 2026 admissions cycle, \u201cby merit-based scores,\u201d accepting the highest-ranking candidates in each nomination category. \u201cMerit-based scores may give weight to unique athletic talent or other experiences such as prior military service or performance at a MSA preparatory school,\u201d the memo says. It\u2019s unclear how the directive will impact the ability of US senators to recommend people for admission to the military academies. The Naval Academy has already removed nearly 400 books from its main library in an attempt to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order in January mandating the removal of all \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d content from K-12 schools, which Hegseth later said also applied to military academies. The Naval Academy also canceled a lecture that author Ryan Holiday was scheduled to give to students there last month after he refused to remove slides from his planned presentation that criticized the academy\u2019s decision to remove the books, CNN reported. A tenured professor of philosophy at West Point wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times on Thursday that he was resigning after 13 years at the school because it was \u201csuddenly eliminating courses, modifying syllabuses and censoring arguments to comport with the ideological tastes of the Trump administration.\u201d The professor, Graham Parsons, wrote that West Point was interpreting Hegseth\u2019s order \u201cbroadly,\u201d and conducting \u201ca sweeping assault on the school\u2019s curriculum and the faculty members\u2019 research.\u201d In response to Parson\u2019s op-ed, Hegseth posted on X on Thursday, \u201cYou will not be missed Professor Parsons,\u201d and the DoD\u2019s rapid response account called Parsons \u201cwoke.\u201d Students and parents also told CNN last month that the anti-DEI policy is having a direct impact on students at Defense Department schools around the globe, as classes like AP Psychology and certain student clubs and books have been banned from DoD schools. The ACLU has sued DoD over the policy. Meanwhile, articles about the Holocaust, the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, cancer awareness, sexual assault and suicide prevention were among the tens of thousands either removed or flagged for removal from Pentagon websites as the department scrambled to comply with Hegseth\u2019s order. The Friday memo standing up the libraries committee said the review of the book removals would be \u201cdeliberate\u201d and conducted by \u201cexperts in the fields of education and the department\u2019s mission.\u201d",

Speaking to journalists in Harare on Tuesday, 29 April, the minister described this as a major achievement. In a video shared by Information Secretary Nick Mangwana on X, Ncube proudly announced that despite limited borrowing space, Zimbabwe is staying on budget. \u201cWe managed to raise US$1,57 billion in terms of revenue. In terms of expenditure, it was US$1,53 billion equivalent. Again, we were able to live within our means as we always do.

The document, which is believed to be a leaked cabinet memorandum, proposes major constitutional changes. Among them: scrapping a section of the constitution that prevents sitting leaders from extending their terms; a move that could allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputies to stay in power until 2031. Other proposals include giving Parliament up to three more years beyond its current five-year limit and shifting control of voter registration from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to the Registrar of Births and Deaths. Speaking exclusively to NewsHub, the minister dismissed the document as fake and slammed social media users for spreading what he called \u201cfalse documents.\u201d He made it clear that if any constitutional changes were coming, they would be done transparently and not in the shadows. \u201cI am sick and tired of social media manufacturing and circulating these false documents. This is not the process the government follows when passing a bill. The bill is a public document, and there is no need to get excited. When the government has finalised it, it will be in the public domain for debate. As the government, if we propose a bill, we do not do so in secrecy. The procedure is public,\u201d he said. While denying that the viral document was legitimate, Ziyambi hinted that Zanu PF might still be working on its own constitutional changes behind the scenes. \u201cMine is coming, wait for it.

      "content": "Paul Mashatile Explains Delay in Beefing Up Security After Assassination Attempt Deputy President Paul Mashatile has opened up about the recent alleged assassination attempt on his life and why his security hasn\u2019t been increased amid allegations that his assassination attempt was staged. Mashatile was returning from an ANC meeting in Boksburg when shots were fired at his convoy. At first, he thought someone was throwing stones at his car. But it quickly became clear that it was gunfire. Speaking during a visit to Greater Ivory Park Zone 15 in Soweto, where he was honouring freedom fighters who were killed by police in 1987, Mashatile addressed the issue head-on. He was asked by eNCA journalist Pule Letshwiti-Jones why his security hadn\u2019t been beefed up following the incident. Mashatile explained that security decisions are not up to him or the President. Those calls are made by the country\u2019s security agencies. He explained: \u201cWell, the President and Deputy President don\u2019t determine their security. It\u2019s an assessment done by the security cluster. At the moment, we are convinced that both the President and Deputy President have adequate security. If they think they need to beef up, they will do so.\u201d While Mashatile downplayed the need for changes, police leadership has already taken action behind the scenes. In a statement issued Tuesday night, police commissioner Fannie Masemola\u2019s spokesperson, Athlenda Mathe, confirmed that extra protection had been deployed for both President Cyril Ramaphosa and his deputy. \u201cGeneral Fannie Masemola confirms the reinforcement of security detail to both principals and has also expressed gratitude with the manner in which members of the Presidential Protection Service (PPS) safeguard and handle the safety of both principals. Members of the PPS who are assigned to both the President and the Deputy President are trained to a high level of skill and possess the necessary expertise and capabilities to avert any risk and threat.

Profanity has always been the heart and soul of Guy Ritchie\u2019s tough guy offerings, but his new Paramount show is saturated in so many c-words that it may just have ushered in the death of swearing. Helen Coffey mourns the senseless dilution of our most beloved curse word I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice When I started watching MobLand, Guy Ritchie\u2019s new London gangster drama featuring an all-star cast including Dame Helen Mirren, Tom Hardy and Pierce Brosnan, I initially thought the most ridiculous thing in it was the accents. There\u2019s Brosnan\u2019s preposterous \u201cIrish\u201d brogue for starters \u2013 even more inexplicable when you consider that the man actually is Irish \u2013 an amalgamation of every terrible \u201ctop o\u2019 the mornin\u2019 to ya!\u201d impression you\u2019ve ever heard, and arguably even worse than his much-mocked turn in the 1988 film Taffin. Then there\u2019s Mirren\u2019s equally scattergun attempt at convincing us she hails from the Emerald Isle, not to mention the myriad botched cockney dialects that frequently threaten to tip over into full Dick Van Dyke territory. But before long, another element in the buzzy new Paramount show, centred around the Harrigan crime family, vied for top dog in the \u201csuspend your disbelief\u201d Olympics. The first time it happened was nine minutes and 45 seconds into episode one: the c-word, flung out in a gritty East End nightclub, the mobster equivalent of a glove slap as the precursor to a duel. Another one landed five seconds later. A third swiftly followed. A brief spell of furious running from Eddie Harrigan (Anson Boon), and then \u201cc***\u201d number four slid into view. At first, I took it in my stride. These are professional criminals, I reasoned; a little potty-mouthed dialogue is par for the course when you\u2019ve got a load of hardmen trying to out-hard each other while strutting around and flashing weaponry. Yet the repetition quickly became so frequent it began to feel a little\u2026 farcical. Silly, even. The word resembled an arbitrary punctuation mark, a kind of lazy shorthand for \u201cLook at us \u2013 we\u2019re ever so tough!\u201d Without even realising I was doing it, I stopped paying attention to the story and switched my focus to counting the \u201cc***s\u201d. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine\u2026 They stopped just shy of double digits in episode one, but I was on a roll now. I continued tallying with a kind of horrified fascination, as if doing an 18-rated version of Count von Count from Sesame Street\u2019s schtick. Episode two saw a dip in usage, with only two during the entire 50-minute runtime, but by episode three we were back, baby: another nine, shoehorned in with all the subtlety of a brick lobbed through a freshly glazed window. The undisputed winner, though, was episode five, the \u201cc***\u201ds coming thick and fast to reach a dizzying total of 11 \u2013 the equivalent of one every three minutes. Five of these were uttered in the final eight minutes alone. The word is used indiscriminately by nearly every character in the show, upon any and every occasion. Feeling lethally angry towards someone? Call them a c***. Mildly aggrieved? Call them a c***. Affectionate? Call them a c***. Sorry for them? Call them a poor c***. It would make an effective drinking game \u2013 take a shot every time you hear the c-word! \u2013 but only if your real aim was to end the evening in A&E getting your stomach pumped. It\u2019s like someone fed Peter Cook and Dudley Moore\u2019s infamous Derek and Clive Live \u201cThis Bloke Came Up To Me\u201d sketch \u2013 which contains an awe-inspiring 36 \u201cc***\u201ds within the space of three minutes and 40 seconds \u2013 into ChatGPT and asked it to burp out a 10-part gangster drama. By the time I\u2019d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word, let alone the most potent one in the English language. I had to catch myself before saying it casually to my mum on the phone; my boss over Slack; the unsuspecting woman on the checkout at Asda. I had to remind myself that calling someone a \u201cc***\u201d is not, in fact, an appropriate response to every situation.

The c-word has long been the undisputed king of swears, one that wields the mightiest power to offend, titillate and make people laugh depending on timing and context. The oldest word for female genitalia in the English language, this is profanity with some historical clout (though, admittedly, it wasn\u2019t offensive back in the 13th century when its first usage was recorded). It may be too much for many Americans\u2019 tastes, and have been watered down into a neutral or complimentary term by the Aussies (see: \u201cHe\u2019s a good c***\u201d), but most Brits hold the expletive in high esteem, understanding its expansive, unrivalled capacity to shock and endear. It\u2019s no coincidence that The White Lotus\u2019s English stars, Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood, both independently named it as their favourite curse word in recent interviews. By the time I\u2019d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word Understand when and where to use it \u2013 shrewdly and with discernment \u2013 and it\u2019s like carrying the sharpest, most adaptable blade in your lexiconic arsenal at all times. National treasure Kathy Burke is the master of this, able to deftly deploy \u201cc***\u201d with the precision and comedic timing it needs to hit a home run. By comparison, MobLand isn\u2019t even attempting to make contact with the ball \u2013 simply lobbing bats across the field at random and hoping one of them hits something. I\u2019m not annoyed by the proliferation of profanity because I\u2019m offended by it. I\u2019m annoyed because MobLand has taken this most special of curses, in all its jagged, ugly elegance, and flogged it to death, diluting it through overexposure and robbing it of its muscle. The sheer abundance of \u201cc***\u201ds ensures they don\u2019t punch through or enhance the dialogue. Instead, they awkwardly stumble across the screen: flabby, toothless, a little embarrassing. It\u2019s like seeing a once-proud empress dethroned and wandering the streets in rags. My heart aches for her. It\u2019s ironic, in a way. In a drama dominated by senseless gangland killings, the murder of our beloved c-word turned out to be the most tragic of all.

      "content": "The director behind the 1999 teen classic has announced three sequels are in development, though sans the original\u2019s biggest star Heath Ledger, who died in 2008. And it\u2019s news that wildly misunderstands the appeal of the original, argues Adam White I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You remains one of the key definitions of a \u201cstar-is-born\u201d performance. Tall, handsome, with blush-worthy levels of camera-ready magnetism, Ledger sauntered into pop-culture consciousness in 1999 as a chain-smoking (rumoured) bad boy teen paid to take an arty cool girl (the similarly luminous Julia Stiles) to prom. Allowed to retain his Aussie accent, Ledger is ludicrously charismatic in the film, all lackadaisical flirtation and alluring ambivalence. Can you even imagine 10 Things\u2026 without him? Well, imagine no more: a Heath-less reboot is in development. Is nothing sacred etc...? Despite celebrity death typically halting unasked-for revivals in their tracks (remember how close we got to a Mrs Doubtfire 2 in the months before Robin Williams\u2019s death in 2014?), a trilogy of sequels to 10 Things I Hate About You is coming down the pipe. The original film\u2019s director Gil Junger has confirmed that each new movie will explore different stages of adult life, which will be reflected in their respective titles: 10 Things I Hate About Dating; 10 Things I Hate About Marriage; and 10 Things I Hate About Kids. How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways. Junger said that he is open to cast members from the first film returning for \u201ccameos\u201d or \u201csmall parts\u201d, mentioning Larry Miller by name \u2013 the actor who played father to Stiles\u2019s moody wallflower. Absent, though, obviously, would be Ledger, who died in 2008 at the depressingly young age of 28. But don\u2019t worry, Junger told People Magazine, it\u2019d be \u201ca beautiful idea\u201d to somehow nod to Ledger in the new movies, adding: \u201cHe deserves to be loved.\u201d Sure! But isn\u2019t there something particularly grim about this, even for an age in which absolutely every bit of pre-existing intellectual property \u2013 The Bodyguard (maybe) with Taylor Swift! Single White Female with Jenna Ortega! Legally Blonde without Reese Witherspoon! \u2013 is being strip-mined for parts? 10 Things wasn\u2019t a film led by its premise, which more or less mirrored the conventions of every other major teen movie in 1999, with its finding-love-through-deception, prom-night-entanglements, enemies-to-lovers, Shakespeare-aping silliness (as any GCSE English student will tell you, its plot was inspired by The Taming of the Shrew). What made it a generational classic was Ledger and Stiles, two preternaturally gifted young actors with intelligence and wit in spades, along with the particularly skilled cast that surrounded them (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gabrielle Union and David Krumholtz). And it was also down to the unusually thoughtful, character-driven script by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, who made sure that Stiles\u2019s moody Kat Stratford was never shamed for being a snarky, alternative bookworm, or transformed \u2013 She\u2019s All That-style \u2013 into something more aggressively conventional. Lutz and Smith are, at this point, not involved in the revival, suggesting this is very much a Gil Junger project. And you can hardly blame his eagerness. Junger, whose last significant movie was 2001\u2019s Martin Lawrence medieval romp Black Knight, has been attempting to mount 10 Things reboots since 2009, first with a short-lived TV series inspired by the film (you probably don\u2019t remember it either), then in 2012 with the film sequel 10 Things I Hate About Life starring Evan Rachel Wood. If that\u2019s inspired you to say \u201chuh?\u201d, it\u2019s because it never got finished \u2013 production was cancelled two months into filming. I understand the impulse for a filmmaker to try and further monetise his biggest hit, but 10 Things I Hate About You isn\u2019t an incredibly flexible bit of IP that can exist as little more than a brand name. It is specific and singular, something only crystallised by the death of its biggest name. I also can\u2019t see anyone being particularly interested in it, either. Without Ledger, there won\u2019t even be the slim pleasure of watching old castmates reuniting (which seems to be the sole impetus behind the forthcoming Freakier Friday with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan). It\u2019ll just be the most currently unemployed cast members from a perfect film from 25 years ago, vainly attempting to resurrect its magic \u2013 and what a miserable idea that is.

And that\u2019s before you factor in its formidable, if unlikely, cast. Transferring from off-Broadway to the National Theatre with a new lineup of actors, the late Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Here We Are is a surreal apocalyptic comedy, which stars Jesse Tyler Ferguson (Modern Family) as a henpecked plastic surgeon, Harry Hadden-Paton (Downton Abbey) as a foot-fetishist bishop, and Jane Krakowski (30 Rock) as an interior designer wafting about cluelessly in a negligee. They just want to go for brunch. But the universe has other ideas, as this stylishly weird, unfinished musical descends into an existential satire of the feckless rich. As his career wore on, Sondheim became increasingly interested in using musical theatre as a space for psychological exploration, choosing abstracted, liminal settings for works such as Follies (1971) and Into The Woods (1986). Even so, we\u2019re on strange, shifting ground here, with a story grafted together by playwright David Ives from two surrealist films from Spanish-Mexican director Luis Bu\u00f1uel: The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Exterminating Angel. It follows a group of wealthy friends marauding around the city in search of something delicious to eat: Sondheim\u2019s score is on urbane, jazzy form as they go to an array of bougie restaurants, only to have their appetites tormented by an empty kitchen, a chef\u2019s funeral, and rubber food. Unusually, these friends mostly sing in chorus together (which explains the casting of stars who aren\u2019t musical theatre regulars) with the solo songs coming from incidental characters such as Denis O\u2019Hare\u2019s beautifully rendered array of servile attendants. \u201cThe Waiter\u2019s Song\u201d is a jaunty comic delight, stuffed with Sondheim's signature wordplay: \u201cWe do expect a little latte later but we haven\u2019t got a lotta latte now.\u201d Ives\u2019 script is full of wit, too, satirising the image-obsessed triviality of this crew: \u201cOh did I tell you, we\u2019re getting the dogs cloned,\u201d pronounces Krakowski\u2019s character, who wants identical poodles to greet her in each of her many homes. Tony Award-winning director Joe Mantello throws body, soul, and a huge amount of cash into making this oddity work \u2013 David Zinn\u2019s astonishingly lavish set design magics up an array of rooms that ought to be preserved in the Met, gorgeously gilded and mirrored, melting into each other and then into the bright, blinking white of nothingness when these friends\u2019 meaningless lives melt away. It\u2019s flip, funny, and undeniably stylish. But essentially unsatisfying, too. An exhaustive eight-page essay in the programme charts the musical\u2019s four decade-long journey from idea to stage, its progress dogged by indecision, the lure of other projects, and procrastination (at one point, Sondheim claimed he couldn\u2019t compose because of an ingrown toenail). In the end, Sondheim died before Here We Are was finished, meaning that the second half of the play is largely bereft of musical numbers. Instead, it descends into a locked-room drama where comfortable privilege descends into ugly anarchy, and rich man\u2019s daughter Fritz (Chumisa Dornford-May) abandons her revolutionary principles in favour of a boot-cupboard tryst with a soldier as the world starts to burn. What\u2019s being attempted here is an act of transubstantiation: the trivial turned into the profound, as these superficial friends are forced to reckon with death and immortality. But Sondheim was tragically unable to finish the songs that would elevate this musical into the transcendental thing it could be. Instead, it\u2019s a beautifully rendered curio for his fans, full of wit and dash \u2013 and a testament to his restless search for meaning in the most unexpected of places.

      "content": "The alienation and emotional askewness of the music is a perfect fit for Yorke\u2019s lyrical themes I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice \u201cEverybody, run, it looks like rain,\u201d drawls Thom Yorke over the mechanised beat and lurid, tuba-aping synths of \u201cBack in the Game\u201d. The first single from the progtronic Tall Tales \u2013 the Radiohead frontman\u2019s first full-length electronic collaboration with Yeovil-born producer/musician Mark Pritchard \u2013 offers disquieting fanfare for a dense, dystopian album. A record full of existential jitters, it addresses themes of human greed, mendacity, disconnection and the climate crisis. Vintage keyboard effects slip, slide and splash in looping melodies, like chunks of ice caps tumbling into the sea, while Yorke\u2019s angsty vocal drifts at a sorrowful altitude. It is, of course, a myth that Yorke only became interested in electronic music when Radiohead were working on 2000\u2019s Kid A. While it\u2019s true that they asked experimental electronic label Warp to send them their entire catalogue in 1999, Yorke was already familiar with their early releases, having played them as a student in Exeter back when he was picking up DJ gigs. It makes sense. The alienation and emotional askewness of the genre is a perfect fit for Yorke\u2019s lyrical themes, counterbalancing what he has irritably described as the \u201cprettiness\u201d of his voice. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, the affable Pritchard explained that he\u2019s been friends with Yorke since 2012 (when Radiohead toured Australia, where he\u2019s based). They first collaborated on the elegiac \u201cBeautiful People\u201d for Pritchard\u2019s Under The Sun album, released in 2016 (the same year Radiohead dropped their last \u2013 and final? \u2013 album A Moon Shaped Pool). Yorke emailed Pritchard again during the lockdown of 2020: trapped at home, he was looking for music he could tinker with remotely, having paused the more organic, band-based work of his other side-project, The Smile. Pritchard pinged back 20 rough tracks composed over the previous decade, and the pair set to work sculpting the strange alien synthscape that became Tall Tales. It\u2019s a filmic sequence of 12 songs that scuttles into being with the sly, crablike bursts of beats and sulphurous, parping bass of \u201cA Fake in a Faker\u2019s World\u201d. While Yorke\u2019s falsetto reaches into the retro-synth, zero-gravity void for \u201cthe force that you cannot see/ Someone to look after me\u201d, Pritchard artfully builds texture and momentum with insectoid percussion and panoramic organ effects that call back to Eighties-era Jean-Michel Jarre. Yorke\u2019s vocals melt into distortion against the slo-mo repetitions of \u201cIce Shelf\u201d. His voice ping-pongs from high to low registers against the arcade-style \u201cpew-pew\u201d effects of \u201cGangsters\u201d, then reaches into a Seventies R&B rasp over the syncopated handclaps and soft splashes of 808 on \u201cThe Conversation is Missing Your Voice\u201d. He channels his inner Lou Reed to drone-rap \u201cWe sign the papers/ We line their pockets\u201d over the trippy harmonium, tambourine and muffled drums of \u201cThe Men Who Dance in Stag\u2019s Heads\u201d. The track conjures hollow-laugh visions of tech bros folk-dancing on the moon. At times, Yorke moonwalks into self-parody with lines such as, \u201cWhat's the purpose?\u201d But such sixth-formery is compensated by the gorgeous melody and elegant phrasing of \u201cBugging Out Again\u201d, so beautiful it's hard to hear with your eyes open.

      "content": "The actor plays a desperate businessman left stranded in the sweltering Australian heat in this manic thriller, but the film\u2019s themes struggle to align with his go-for-broke performance I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The triggers for Nicolas Cage\u2019s vengeful ire have grown increasingly obscure of late. Normally, he\u2019s battling to get back his wife (2018\u2019s Mandy), his daughter (2012\u2019s Stolen), or his granddaughter (2011\u2019s Drive Angry). Now he\u2019s battling to get back his favourite hog (2021\u2019s Pig) and, with The Surfer, his favourite longboard. Yet, these films, inevitably, offer the same sell: people come for the Cage-ness of it all, the bug-eyed grimace, the air karate chop, the erratic, ever-escalating inflection. It\u2019s the inevitable metric by which they\u2019re judged. But as Cage grows more violent over smaller transgressions, directors have offered him a little more room to work. The Surfer is what you might call a slow-burn Cage. There\u2019s the manic, hollering prize at the end (and even a line of dialogue worthy of a future meme), but also plenty of the actor\u2019s more undervalued speciality \u2013 the expression of gargantuan helplessness, the look of a fish who\u2019s been thrown to land and left to die. Here, he plays an Australian-born, American-raised businessman returning to his birthplace with the intention of buying his family\u2019s old beach home. Life has turned cruel for him: his estranged wife is shacked up with another man, his son (Finn Little) seems distant, and his boss is wondering why he turned up to their last meeting with no shoes or socks. The plan, then, is to come back and reroot himself, to reconstruct his innocence. Only, the second he turns up to his old surfing haunt, the local \u201cBay Boys\u201d get up in his face and bellow, \u201cdon\u2019t live here, don\u2019t surf here\u201d. He\u2019s become a stranger to everywhere. When the Bay Boys swipe his surfboard, he\u2019s left haunting the beach car park. Somehow he\u2019s both unable and unwilling to leave, as he\u2019s systematically stripped of his possessions and identity, dehydrated and near-starved to death in the sweltering Australian heat. \u201cI have a car! I have a job! I have a name!\u201d he cries. Ironically, we never do find out the last one in that list. It makes us feel complicit in his humiliation. Irish filmmaker Lorcan Finnegan is fluent in the language of disorientation. Every crash zoom, every leering close-up, every flash forward (or backward?), every mocking cutaway to Australian wildlife, every shot of a split bag of dog faeces strategically dropped on the water fountain \u2013 it all exists to push Cage\u2019s character towards the expected endpoint of total insanity. Under the glare of Razek Ladczuk\u2019s sun-baked cinematography, the actor\u2019s skin has never looked more orange and his teeth so white. It\u2019s effective. Finnegan has deployed such open-air claustrophobia multiple times before. In his second feature, Vivarium, Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg played a couple who move into a suburban development, only to realise they can never leave. Its ideas were whip-smart and coherent \u2013 the pair looked, essentially, like they were trapped in a Ren\u00e9 Magritte painting, forced to enact heteronormativity against their own will. Here, Thomas Martin\u2019s script loads the ammo but fails to land the shot. The Surfer is about individualism and masculinity, about the desire to own and claim space. Julian McMahon plays Bay Boy leader Scally with a finely tuned mix of breezy confidence and open hostility, while wearing a red towel hoodie that could easily be mistaken for cultist\u2019s robes. It\u2019s pointed out that he is, to quote, a \u201ctrust fund bitch\u201d, appropriating the bohemian beach lifestyle (and, at certain points, Aboriginal culture). But to what degree he and our protagonist share, or don\u2019t share, in the vicious cycle of bro-hood feels hazy. The Surfer, instead, simply relinquishes control to Cage. That\u2019s fine.

      "content": "Cassie Ventura, the former girlfriend of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs and one of his accusers, could take the stand as early as Monday as one of the first three witnesses called in the government\u2019s sex-trafficking case against the music mogul. Prosecutors indicated in court on Friday that they would call two \u201cquick\u201d witnesses before calling \u201cVictim 1,\u201d whose testimony will take up most of the first week. Ventura, who is pregnant with her third child and due to deliver next month, is referred to as \u201cVictim 1\u201d in the indictment but has agreed to testify in her own name. Prosecutors allege Combs coerced her into having sex with male prostitutes, according to the indictment. Combs\u2019 attorneys have said all sex was consensual. Combs\u2019 defense team said in court they plan to argue that Ventura had a propensity for violence toward Combs during their relationship, which lasted approximately 11 years, from 2007 to 2018. \u201cWe are going to take the position that there was mutual violence in their relationship,\u201d defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in court Friday. \u201cThat there was hitting on both sides,\u201d Agnifilo added. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to refer to it as domestic violence.\u201d The defense attorneys said they may want to ask Ventura about violent interactions they say she\u2019s had unrelated to the allegations in this case, which they allege will discredit the claim Combs coerced her into sexual activity. The judge said he would rule on that Monday. Combs nodded when his lawyer Alexandra Shapiro said, \u201cThe dynamic between these two individuals is at the very heart of this case.\u201d Ventura\u2019s attorney, Douglas Wilder, declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all charges, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Among the topics likely to be raised in Ventura\u2019s testimony is hotel surveillance footage from 2016 that shows Combs grabbing, kicking and dragging her. Despite attempts by his attorneys to exclude the footage from evidence, Judge Arun Subramanian issued a ruling last month that it could be shown to the jury at trial. After CNN first published video of the incident last May, Combs posted an apology on his Instagram account, saying, \u201cMy behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.\u201d Jury selection was initially set to be finalized on Friday, but Judge Subramanian expressed concern that some prospective jurors could get cold feet before the start of opening statements on Monday. The judge struck two jurors from the prospective pool of 45, reducing the overall pool to 43. One woman who was qualified earlier in the week contacted the court expressing issues of personal well-being, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in court. A man was struck from the pool because he didn\u2019t disclose an open lawsuit he\u2019s pursuing against the city of New York during questioning. \u201cWe may be in a situation where on Monday we\u2019re starting out already down some alternate jurors,\u201d the judge said. Assistant US attorney Maurene Comey said the government \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d any delays. \u201cIf one raises his or her hand and says I have an issue we could have an avalanche effect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are also working against a clock on our end which we\u2019re very cognizant of next week.\u201d Judge Subramanian said the pool of 43 will be called to arrive by 8:30am Monday morning, so they can start opening statements at 9:30 as originally planned. The trial is anticipated to last eight weeks. CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.",

The former daytime talk-show host recently shared with her social media followers how different both she and her view look these days. In a video posted on her verified Instagram account, a now brunette DeGeneres is seen riding a lawnmower on her British estate. The comedian shared the video in the form of the popular \u201cHow it started\u2026how it\u2019s going\u201d trend. The footage start with her riding the mower and ends with her needing to be pushed when the machine breaks down. \u201cPortia thought it would be fun to film my first time on the mower,\u201d the caption reads. \u201cShe was right.\u201d The actress Portia de Rossi has been married to DeGeneres since 2008. DeGeneres and de Rossi reportedly moved to the United Kingdom in November 2024. The move came more than two years after \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d finished its run in 2022.

      "content": "In the latest development in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, Lively\u2019s lawyers Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb have confirmed that the actress intends to take the stand when the case heads to trial next year. \u201cThis is a case about what happened to Blake Lively when she raised claims of sexual harassment on set and the retaliation that followed. Of course she will testify,\u201d Hudson and Gottlieb said in a statement to CNN on Thursday. Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and retaliation in a complaint first filed with the California Civil Rights Department in December, preceding a lawsuit that followed about a week later. She also claimed that Baldoni, along with his PR representatives, orchestrated a \u201csocial manipulation campaign\u201d to hurt her reputation in the media while they were promoting \u201cIt Ends with Us,\u201d their 2024 film at the center of the dispute. First reported by People, Gottlieb said on Thursday that Lively plans to testify because \u201cthe ultimate moment for a plaintiff\u2019s story to be told is at trial.\u201d \u201cWe expect that to be the case here (with Lively),\u201d he added. \u201cSo we would, of course, expect her to be a witness at her trial.\u201d When reached for comment on Thursday, Baldoni\u2019s lawyer Bryan Freedman said, \u201cAlthough obviously uncomfortable for the Lively parties, the truth is not a distraction. The truth has been clearly shown through unedited receipts, documents and real life footage.\u201d In an amended complaint filed in February, Lively alleged other women also raised claims about Baldoni\u2019s behavior on set. Freedman previously denied the allegations in a statement to CNN, saying, \u201cThese claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media.\u201d Gottlieb stopped short of confirming whether Lively\u2019s husband Ryan Reynolds will testify at trial, saying that it\u2019s his belief that Baldoni\u2019s allegations against Reynolds are \u201cfrivolous.\u201d Along with Lively, Reynolds is named as a defendant in the $400 million defamation lawsuit Baldoni filed in January. Baldoni has accused Reynolds of assisting Lively in \u201chijacking\u201d his film and taking down his career. He claimed that Reynolds, who had no formal role on \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d re-wrote a scene and made \u201cunauthorized changes to the script in secret.\u201d Baldoni also accused Reynolds of reprimanding him at the couple\u2019s home in New York and alleged Reynolds made fun of him in \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d mirroring the character Nicepool after Baldoni in an effort to mock him. In March, Gottlieb filed a request for Reynolds to be dropped as a defendant from Baldoni\u2019s suit, claiming that his argument against Reynolds has no legal bounds and amounts to \u201churt feelings.\u201d If Reynolds is dropped as a defendant, then he \u201cmay or may not be a fact witness\u201d at trial, Gottlieb added. There are other individuals who will be testifying at trial to support Lively\u2019s claims, said Gottlieb, adding that these individuals \u201cwere witnesses to or experienced misconduct that is relevant to Ms. Lively\u2019s claims\u201d and that he expects these witnesses to testify about \u201cwhat took place on set.\u201d Baldoni also accused Lively in his defamation suit of working to \u201cdestroy\u201d him professionally by collaborating with the New York Times on an article about the complaint she filed with the California Civil Rights Department in December. Baldoni, who directed and starred alongside Lively in \u201cIt Ends with Us,\u201d also filed a libel suit against the New York Times in January, in which he claimed that the newspaper published an article \u201crife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions.\u201d A spokesperson for The New York Times told CNN at the time that the publication plans to \u201cvigorously defend against the lawsuit.\u201d Both Baldoni and Lively\u2019s attorneys have previously said that they do not intend to settle. The trial is currently set for March 2026. CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.",

Pitt\u2019s lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed. \u201cUnfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt \u2014 an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes \u2014 can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\u201d Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press. He added, \u201cIn reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\u201d Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt\u2019s case has not done. The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch (10-centimeter-by-10-centimeter) piece of lumber. The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021. Pitt, who grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, played the character Jimmy Darmody for two seasons on HBO\u2019s \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d with the cast led by Steve Buscemi winning Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2011 and 2012 for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The show also won a Golden Globe for best drama series in 2011. His first major role came in the 2001 film \u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch.\u201d In 2005, he starred in \u201cLast Days,\u201d director Gus Van Sant\u2019s film about a fictional rock star inspired by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He also played Henry Parker in one season of The WB\u2019s \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d in 1999-2000.",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr7lv7pw2po",
      "content": "Reality TV star Molly-Mae Hague has confirmed she and Tommy Fury are back together, after announcing their split last August. The pair met on the 2019 series of Love Island, later becoming engaged and welcoming their daughter Bambi in 2023. Hague announced their split last year, and suggested in her subsequent docuseries that Fury's drinking had become a problem in the relationship. But in the latest episodes, released on Friday, Hague confirmed they were back together, saying Fury had not drunk alcohol for four months and that \"things are looking so much better\". Hague is the most successful former Love Island contestant, with 8.5 million Instagram followers and her own clothing brand. Speaking in a new episode of her Amazon Prime Video docuseries, Behind It All Part II, Hague described the relationship as \"worth saving\". She added she does not want to rush anything with Fury but to take \"things slow\" as the couple rebuild. \"I love Tommy so much and I love our family so much that I'm willing to ride the wave,\" Hague said. \"And that's not something that everyone wants to do, but it's something that I'm willing to do because I want my family.\" She continued: \"Obviously, he knows it's the drink. He's not drank now for what, four months? \"I don't think the drink's gone away forever. Do I think that drink could still be a problem for us, potentially? Yeah, but I think the break-up showed Tommy that I'm serious.\" \"He's just really different these days.\" The news comes several months after Hague and Fury were seen kissing at a New Year's Eve party. In January, Hague denied their break-up had been a \"publicity stunt\", adding that the situation was \"really complicated\". In the new episodes of her TV series, Hague also spoke about a recent family holiday with Fury and Bambi which Mae described as \"picture perfect\". \"Dubai was picture perfect, like it was just the best trip ever,\" she said. \"It just felt like everything I wanted it to be, and more. It was exactly what we needed. \"All the noise of everyone, just like it just switched off everyone's opinions. Nothing mattered. It was just like us in our bubble.\" She added: \"Things are looking so much better for us. I'm gonna start spending more time at Tommy's house, keeping things slow and not rushing anything. \"But, as always, I always say I don't know what the future holds. I don't think it's going to be a plain sailing future. I don't, that's just me being honest. I think we're still going to have bumps. \"The dream is still the same that, you know, we'll get to a place one day when we will all be happy in that house together and have more children, hopefully, and just have a really nice, happy life together. That's all I've ever wanted for us. \"I don't want to get too excited, but I'm getting glimmers of what I always wanted, which is, my family. \"I know that we have got something completely worth saving but you never know what's around the corner.\" Fury previously said he was \"heartbroken\" by the split, while Hague said in August she was \"extremely upset\" their relationship had ended. The second instalment of Mae's docuseries follows three episodes which were released in January. Hague was born in Stevenage and grew up in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, while Fury was born and raised in Manchester. Fury is the brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, and is also a boxer himself.",

      "title": "Why these 2000s indie heroes are back and bigger than everAfter being dismissed as \"indie landfill\", many guitar bands are back with a vengeance after 20 years.23 hrs agoCulture",
      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5d04r634go",
      "content": "\"I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself.\" Luke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer. Both admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur. \"But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,\" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie. \"It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other.\" The Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom \u2013 a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump. Over the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts. Angular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day. By 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkeys' incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out. But the party couldn't last forever. In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves. Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"? Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal). \"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer. \"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\" \"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\" In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld. But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes. \"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer. The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album. The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences. But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Na\u00efve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok. Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience. How do they explain this sudden revival? \"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes. \"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\" But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse. \"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff. \"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\" Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\". But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs. \"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer. A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry. The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 \u2013 making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies. Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up. The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise. \"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer. \"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\" Are there any reviews seared into their memories? \"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\" \"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\" While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music. \"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\" \"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests. \"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\" But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman. Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world. \"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\" \"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now. \"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\" With hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records. Pritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week. \"I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,\" he says. \"So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started -  not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again.\" The result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves. Archer is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year. So, have the bands got a five-year plan? \"Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,\" laughs Pritchard. \"I think it's good to have goals!\" \"Do you really?\" asks Archer, with a concerned frown. \"I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.\"",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdj9wpk2nxjo",
      "content": "An art expert who has worked on the BBC's Bargain Hunt has admitted failing to report a series of high-value art sales to a man suspected of financing the proscribed group Hezbollah. Oghenochuko Ojiri, 53, pleaded guilty to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000 of failing to make a disclosure during the course of business, the first prosecution of its kind. The court heard on Friday that Ojiri sold artwork worth \u00a3140,000 to Nazem Ahmad, who is accused of supporting the Lebanon-based group and was sanctioned by the US in 2019. Lyndon Harris, prosecuting, said Ojiri had read news reports showing Ahmad had been sanctioned and discussed this with other people. The offences took place between October 2020 and December 2021. Ojiri founded Ramp Gallery, now known as the Ojiri Gallery, based in east London. Mr Harris said: \"There is one discussion where Ojiri is party to a conversation where it is apparent a lot of people have known for years about [Ahmad's] terrorism links.\" He added that \"Ramp Gallery engaged a third party to advise on compliance matters\" but that the advice given was \"not properly acted on\". Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that Ojiri \"dealt with Mr Ahmad directly, negotiated the sales of artwork and congratulated him on purchases\". The prosecution's case claimed that at the time of the transactions, there was a significant amount of online material showing Ahmad's alleged links to the \"blood diamond\" trade - a reference to how diamonds are sometimes used to fund armed conflict and insurgencies. Ahmad was also sanctioned by the UK government in April 2023, which froze his assets and banned UK nationals from doing business with him or his companies. That restriction was imposed on the day Ojiri was arrested. At the time, the UK government said Ahmad had \"an extensive art collection in the UK\" and conducted business \"with multiple UK-based artists, art galleries and auction houses\". Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon and is backed by Iran. It is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. Ojiri, also known as Ochuko Ojiri, was charged following an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's specialist arts and antiques unit, alongside the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) and HMRC. Under the legislation, it is an offence if people do not notify police if they know or suspect a business associate to have been involved in financing a proscribed group. According to the prosecution, Ojiri told police he did not support terrorist activity and was sorry for what he had done. He said he knew who Ahmad was and he denied that money or greed were motivating factors, saying it was more because of the excitement and kudos of dealing with a \"name\" in the collecting world. Ojiri is listed on Bargain Hunt's website as one of the show's experts. He is not a member of BBC staff, works as a freelance presenter and has also appeared on Antiques Road Trip and Channel 5's Storage: Flog the Lot! He has not worked on BBC programmes since 2023. A BBC spokesperson said: \"It would not be appropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\" District Judge Briony Clarke granted Ojiri bail but ordered him to surrender his passport. Gavin Irwin, mitigating, told the court Ojiri was not a flight risk. He will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 6 June.",

      "content": "A free beachfront concert in Kent by chart-topping rapper Dizzee Rascal has been axed just hours before it was set to begin. The Sevenoaks-based musician posted a video on social media encouraging fans to \"pull up\" to a free concert on the Margate Steps on Friday at 18:00 BST. But music promoters Margate Summer Series said he had been forced to pull the plug on the impromptu event, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In a public statement, alongside an image labelling the gig postponed, it said: \"Dizzee Rascal will be rescheduled due to filming taking place in Margate today. Hold tight, more news coming soon.\" \"Tonight in Margate on the Kings Steps, it's a pull up, don't call it a pop up, I'm coming down there, we're going to have a rave up, yeah?\" the artist had said in a video to his more than half a million Instagram followers. The video gained thousands of views in just hours. Dizzee Rascal, real name Dylan Kwabena Mills, was made an MBE for services to music in 2020. In 2003, aged 19, he became the youngest artist to win the Mercury Prize, with his debut album Boy in da Corner. A graphic promoting the event had been shared by Margate Summer Series \u2013 the promoters of Dreamland's summer concerts \u2013 saying: \"Bring your friends, your mum, your dad, even your little sister. Everyone's welcome!\" Ward councillor for Margate Central and former mayor of the town Rob Yates said he had emailed Dreamland on seeing the social media posts. \"I think it's an irresponsible ticket stunt,\" he said. The London-born rapper and Mike Skinner of The Streets are set to perform at the Marine Terrace venue on 29 August. Dreamland's operations manager Shane Guy wrote in an email to Yates about the unplanned seafront gig: \"This event is not being organised by Dreamland. \"We have been in contact with the promoter and management team for Dizzee Rascal with a firm request that it be cancelled immediately and that a statement goes out confirming cancellation to all media and social media channels.\" Yates said there had been \"no liaison\" with the council. He added: \"It's council land, it's dangerous to hold it right next to the sea, there's no police, medics or planning.\" It is understood that Thanet District Council and the police are aware.

A spokesperson for the show's producers said: \"Due to unforeseen circumstances, the UK tour of Let the Right One In is no longer able to proceed as planned.\" They said ticket holders would be contacted directly by their point of purchase with refund information.

The play tells a story of vampires, love, loneliness and survival, and was directed by Bryony Shanahan.

Fans chuckled, friends applauded, and his wife, Saskia Snyman, shared the fun online. \u201cMine is the only one not wearing a bowtie \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02,\u201d she joked. It\u2019s classic RG\u2014doing things differently, confidently, and with a sense of humour only he can pull off. RG walked into the awards with Viking energy\u2014bold, tall, and rocking his own style. While teammates polished their bow ties, RG tied his long tie with pride. The outfit blended rugged charm and red-carpet class. With his signature beard and sharp suit, he truly owned the moment. Saskia, in her elegant gown, stood beside him laughing as he broke tradition once more. Her Instagram post quickly made waves. But the night wasn\u2019t just about the outfit. RG won Leinster\u2019s Player of the Year Award for the 2024/25 season. The crowd roared. He smiled humbly, tie and all. His performance this season has been unstoppable. His character\u2014off the field\u2014is just as legendary. From scrums to suits, RG proves that style and substance can go hand in hand.

      "content": "Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus named his dog after his childhood nickname. Rassie isn\u2019t just a rugby mastermind and a proud dog lover. Recently, he\u2019s been sharing heartwarming videos of his furry companion on social media. Fans are getting a rare glimpse into his softer, playful side. But this isn\u2019t just any dog \u2014 it carries a piece of Rassie\u2019s childhood. As a young boy, Rassie was known for his determination and curiosity. These traits have shaped him into the coach he is today. Now, those memories come to life every time he calls his dog\u2019s name \u2014 a special name with deep roots. The dog\u2019s name is Kwedini \u2014 a Xhosa word meaning \u201cyoung man.\u201d This was Rassie\u2019s nickname as a child. The name was given to him by his father, a man who often interacted with people from different language backgrounds. Through those experiences, he picked up several cultural terms. \u201cKwedini\u201d stuck with young Rassie. It represented a boy full of potential and energy. Rassie\u2019s bond with his dog is more than companionship. Every bark, every walk, takes him back to his childhood. Naming his dog Kwedini is a tribute to his roots and his dad\u2019s influence. In a video posted by Smash Rugby, the caption read, \u201cWhat do you call a future man who\u2019s still learning the ropes? You call him Kwedini.\u201d That message perfectly captured the essence of the name. Rassie uses his time with Kwedini to reflect, recharge, and remember where it all started. The playful pup reminds him of youthful dreams and the journey he\u2019s walked. It\u2019s clear that even rugby giants have tender sides. And sometimes, all it takes to unlock those memories is a dog and a name. A post shared by SmashRugby (@smashrugby_) After the Springboks capain Rassie Erasmus revealed his nickname, fans love it, and also loved the dog. @Meghan Pretorius (Eurelle) \u201c@amybecameaking\u00a0just when you thought we couldn\u2019t love him more \ud83d\ude2b\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc36\u201d @Helen Joseph \u201cAlways keeping it real ..\u201d @Kim Charles \u201cLove that dog \u2013 so beautiful\u201d  Follow Us on Google News for Immediate Updates",

Read our Privacy notice Xabi Alonso has confirmed he will leave Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season. The Spaniard led German outfit to a famous league and cup double across a remarkable unbeaten domestic season last year. But after coming up short in his attempt to retain the Bundesliga title, Alonso confirmed his decision to depart ahead of Sunday\u2019s home clash with Borussia Dortmund, ending a three-year spell at the club. \"This week, the club and I have agreed that these last two games are going to be my last as Leverkusen coach,\" Alonso said. \"Now is the right moment to announce it. \"We want to have a proper farewell on Sunday. This morning I have talked with players and staff. For sure it is a moment with mixed emotions. \"I have to be thankful for everyone - from the fans, the people in the club and for sure the players. We can be happy and we can be proud of what we have achieved. We are taking the club in the right direction.\" Alonso is set to take over from Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid manager, reuniting with the club he spent five successful years at - winning La Liga in 2012 before helping the Galacticos to Champions League glory over city rivals Atletico in 2014. The 43-year-old was one game away from securing a historic treble last season as he looked to add a Europa League to his Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal titles - only to be thwarted by an Ademola Lookman hat-trick in Dublin as Atalanta came out 3-0 final victors. Nevertheless, Alonso accomplished an incredible turnaround at the BayArena, with his appointment in October 2022 coming when Leverkusen sat in the relegation zone of the Bundesliga after their worst start to a season since 1979. After propelling them up the table in his debut season to earn European qualification, Alonso then embarked on a 35-game Bundesliga unbeaten streak to win Bayer Leverkusen a first ever top-flight title. The Spaniard was strongly linked with a return to former club Liverpool last summer, but opted to stay put in Germany for what would be one more season. He will now leave the club after the last game of the season at Mainz, with a move to the Bernabeu beckoning.

      "content": "A decision has reportedly been made following the abandonment of Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday following rising tensions between the country and Pakistan I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been suspended by the Indian cricket board following rising tensions between the country and Pakistan, a source with direct knowledge of the situation has told Reuters. Thursday's IPL match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in the hill city of Dharamsala was abandoned midway amid fighting on the border regions, though the cricket board maintained the decision was due to a power failure at the stadium. The decision left the immediate future for the money-spinning T20 tournament in doubt, though IPL chairman Arun Singh Dhumal and the Indian cricket board's secretary Devajit Saikia did not respond to Reuters calls. The world's richest cricket tournament began its current season on March 22, and the final fixture was scheduled to be played on May 25, with matches being spread over 13 venues across the country. The nuclear-armed neighbours have been locked in conflict since Wednesday, when India targeted multiple locations in Pakistan, claiming they were \"terrorist infrastructure\" in response to a deadly attack in Kashmir last month. New Delhi named two Pakistani nationals as suspects and accused Islamabad of being involved in the attack, a charge Pakistan denied and sought an independent probe. India's army said Pakistan's armed forces carried out \"multiple attacks\" using drones and other munitions across the entire western border on Thursday night and early Friday, a claim Pakistan denied. Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals were both awarded one point after the decision to abandon the match, with rain and a wet outfield initially delaying the start by an 90 minutes. \u201cDue to a power outage in the area, one of the light towers at the HPCA stadium malfunctioned,\" the IPL said in a statement. \"BCCI regrets the inconvenience caused to the in-stadium attendees.\u201d It was the final game of the season in Dharamsala, with the IPL shifting Punjab\u2019s scheduled game on Sunday against Mumbai Indians to Ahmedabad over the India-Pakistan tensions. Airports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh, where the Punjab Kings are based, have been closed for civilian and commercial purposes since Wednesday, with more airports in India\u2019s northwestern corridor also closed off.

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/09/sport/austin-forkner-supercross-racing-profile-spt",
      "content": "Motorcycle racing is dangerous, of that there is no doubt. But within the sport there is one category that sits (bruised) head and (fractured) shoulders above the others. Supercross is a spectacular form of dirt-bike racing played out in stadiums, with wild jumps, eye-widening speeds and battling competition. Few riders embody the sport and its elements more than Austin Forkner, the most successful rider in the 250SX class never to win a title. The Missouri native has come close, but painful on-track mishaps have always gotten in the way. With its speed, acrobatics and general entertainment factor, Forkner tells CNN Sports that no sport has the blend of ingredients that Supercross offers: \u201cIt\u2019s got the technicality of golf, we\u2019re playing with inches out there. \u201cIt\u2019s got the brutalness or gnarliness of fighting, like UFC fighting \u2026 then it\u2019s got the physicality of, like, a triathlete. You have to be in such good shape, you have to be ready to be injured and ready to go to war, basically.\u201d Talking to CNN at Triumph Racing America\u2019s headquarters in picturesque countryside south of Atlanta, Georgia, the 26-year-old begins to list the injuries he has sustained in the saddle, gesturing to different parts of his body. \u201cI\u2019ll just go through them. I\u2019ve done this collarbone three times, this collarbone twice; I broke this wrist, I broke my hip, my hip socket, I guess. Let\u2019s see \u2013 when I was young, I broke my ankle and the growth plate \u2026\u201d It\u2019s completely understandable that Forkner would have to think about it because this list goes on and on \u2026 and on. Far more broken bones and smashed body parts, in fact, than there is space here to list: \u201cI\u2019ve torn my ACL, or torn everything in my knee, basically, my right knee twice, my left knee once. A post shared by CNN Sports (@cnnsport) \u201cI\u2019ve torn my labrum in my shoulder twice, tore it, then retore it again. I actually had four surgeries on this shoulder within, like, 18 months, from two collarbones and two labrums. I compression-fractured my back a few years ago \u2026 and I rode with it because I didn\u2019t know that it was compression-fractured.\u201d These are still just some of the injuries this extraordinary competitor has overcome in his career. It takes Forkner almost three minutes to relay all of them; he has even had part of his pancreas removed, along with his spleen. But the most serious setback was not directly related to racing at all. In fact, were it not for the fact that the rider was being examined after a bad crash, it might never have been discovered. \u201cLast year, after the crash where I broke my back and my shoulder and I was knocked out for like five minutes, they were doing scans on my head and they found out that I had something called an AVM (arteriovenous malformation),\u201d Forkner explains. \u201cAnd I actually had to have brain surgery to have that taken out.\u201d A post shared by Austin Forkner (@austinforkner) AVM is a tangle of blood vessels that typically forms during fetal development and leads to irregular connections between arteries and veins in the brain. While many people born with AVMs live normal lives without even noticing, such malformations can be dangerous, even fatal if left untreated. Forkner admits that it was a shock to find out brain surgery was needed. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve done everything \u2013 I\u2019ve done knees, shoulders, collarbones, wrists, ankles, everything like that, back,\u201d he tells CNN, \u201cit\u2019s kind of two things you don\u2019t really think about having surgery on: that\u2019s your heart and your brain.\u201d The surgery itself, while relatively routine, was an intimidating prospect. \u201cThey cut me from here to here, basically,\u201d Forkner explains, gesturing across his hairline. \u201c(They) had to essentially kind of pull the front part of my brain out of my skull a little bit so they could get down to what they were trying to do.\u201d The other troubling aspect of the surgery was the recovery, he says. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t really know what that meant for my career, just because, like all the other injuries, you\u2019ll be back in, whatever, ACL, six months, any broken bone, six to eight weeks, you know, they kind of can give you a time frame,\u201d Forkner continues. \u201cThis was kind of, \u2018We don\u2019t know.\u2019 So, it was pretty scary in that way, but not speaking anything about (my career), it was just scary. It was just scary to have my brain opened up, basically.\u201d After the event, though, perhaps unsurprisingly given the rider\u2019s track record of recovering from injuries, Forkner\u2019s path back into the saddle was relatively smooth and swift. \u201cIf I could have (gone) to the gym two weeks after, I probably would have (gone) to the gym two weeks after,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI was basically limited because the doctor didn\u2019t want me to get my heart rate up, get the blood really flowing through there. He was like, \u2018We need to be chill, because part of it is that the AVM can cause seizures, strokes, and aneurysms.\u201d Not long after his return to fitness, however, Forkner made a big decision, uprooting from California, where he\u2019d spent most of his career, and leaving his Kawasaki team to move to Georgia and join the relative newcomers to dirt bike racing, Triumph. But the Richards, Missouri-born rider was actually quite happy to leave California behind. \u201cIt was a big change coming from California all the way out here. I like Georgia way better than California. \u201cIt has the Midwest kind of small towns, you know, we\u2019re out here, this reminds me exactly of the Midwest where I grew up, ponds and green grass. I\u2019m way more at home here than I was in California.\u201d The move also meant adapting to a completely new bike: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can understand exactly how much work goes into setting the bike up. The best way that I can explain it to somebody is that the forks or the front suspension on my bike, if they move that 0.5 millimeter, I feel it. \u201cLet\u2019s say there\u2019s 10 to 12 turns on the track; if the bike turns better or doesn\u2019t in certain sections, that could be a 10th of a second per turn. Ten turns, that\u2019s a second a lap. A second a lap is a lot.\u201d Jeremy Coker, general manager of Triumph Racing America, gushes about Forkner\u2019s talent, but acknowledges that his team was taking a risk of its own bringing him on board. \u201cAustin Forkner has a one-of-a-kind talent. I think if you were to ask any rider, any competitor that he races with, they\u2019re going to say that he\u2019s probably the most talented and fastest rider there is,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cI think all of the injuries that he sustained, especially his brain injury, was a big setback for him,\u201d Coker continues. \u201cI think at that point that not only were people scared to hire him in the fact that maybe he\u2019s not going to be as fast as he once was. \u201cBut also, the scare factor of \u2013 is this dangerous? Is this a risk that we\u2019re willing to take? If he crashes, can he sustain a worse injury? Could it \u2026 as far as you know, kill him? I don\u2019t mean to say it like that, but it\u2019s a big risk. It\u2019s something that\u2019s scary.\u201d Undoubtedly the biggest change of all for Forkner, however, came when he and his wife \u2013 model and influencer Rylee Forkner \u2013 celebrated the arrival of their son, Atlas Hope, in March of this year. The rider admits that fatherhood has already changed him. \u201cI love my little boy more than anything else. It\u2019s funny because everybody says it, it changes \u2026 your riding and stuff like that, and it changed it as far as I realized that yes, dirt bikes are my job, they\u2019re my living,\u201d Forkner says, \u201cbut for so long dirt bikes have been the only thing. They\u2019ve been the most important thing. They\u2019ve been all I think about when I wake up and all I think about when I go to bed, and now they\u2019re not. A post shared by RYLEE FORKNER (@ryleeforkner) \u201cNow (racing is) important because it\u2019s my job, but whether I have a good day at the track or a bad day at the track and I go home and I can hold my little boy, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it makes it not matter. \u201cIt takes the added pressure that I put on myself off because I\u2019m just like, \u2018Hey, whether I win, whether I get last, I get to go home and hold my boy and everything\u2019s gonna be OK.\u2019\u201d He also concedes that his new responsibilities are on his mind at the track: \u201cThat is something that has been a little bit of a battle this year, fighting the, \u2018I need to go home. I need to be safe for my wife and my kid.\u2019 \u201cBut then at the same time, you can\u2019t ride with that lingering over you. Because you won\u2019t ride loose and ride natural when you have something like that, telling yourself, \u2018Be careful, you can\u2019t ride like that\u2019 \u2013 so it\u2019s a process.\u201d Perhaps though, the most revealing thing about being a father was the new insight into his relationship with his own parents. \u201cHonestly, one of the biggest things about having a kid now is that it puts into perspective a lot my parents and what they\u2019ve had to deal with, with me, just as far as how upset it makes you,\u201d Forkner says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever seen my mom at a race, she\u2019s a disaster to watch a race with, she\u2019s freaking out, grabbing somebody, but I understand that now, I understand that side of things, like how upset it must make her to see me go through \u2013 to see me just get beat down over and over again. I understand what that could do to you as a mother.\u201d Would he encourage his son Atlas Hope to follow in his footsteps? \u201cI\u2019m gonna be hard pressed to tell him no,\u201d Forkner smiles, \u201cas far as if I\u2019m gonna advise him to become a professional dirt bike rider. I don\u2019t know if I would, I\u2019m probably gonna advise against it. \u201cIn certain ways I can get a little bit bitter about the sport. Well yes, it\u2019s given me a great life and I met all my friends, my wife, everybody that I know I\u2019ve met through dirt bikes basically, but I\u2019ve also seen a lot of the dark side of the sport. \u201cBut a lot of that has come from professional dirt bike racing where we are pushing the limits every single day, and that\u2019s hard and that\u2019s stressful, so am I gonna tell him he can\u2019t ever touch a dirt bike? No. But I would prefer if we just do it for fun.\u201d",

      "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves made the most of Steph Curry\u2019s absence to level their Western Conference semifinals series against the Golden State Warriors with a wire-to-wire 117-93 win in Game 2. Minnesota opened the game on a 13-0 run as it took Golden State almost five minutes to register its first points. The lead quickly swelled to 22 points midway through the second quarter. Related article\nSteph Curry out for at least a week after injury in Game 1 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves The Warriors reduced the deficit to seven in the third quarter on a Jonathan Kuminga three, Minnesota\u2019s smallest lead since the opening minute of the game, but then went on a four-and-a-half-minute scoreless run that ended any hopes of a win. \u201cWe made a really spirited run, got it to seven, and then we just kind of lost a little bit of composure,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, per Reuters. \u201cWe turned it over right out of that timeout a couple of times and gave up a couple threes where we lost connection defensively. But we learned a lot, and I think this game will help us figure out how to move forward.\u201d Julius Randle powered the Timberwolves to victory with a game-high 24 points to go with seven rebounds and 11 assists. Star guard Anthony Edwards \u2013 who had to be helped to the locker room with an ankle injury in the second quarter, but later returned \u2013 and Nickeil Alexander-Walker both added 20 points \u201cWe watched film yesterday,\u201d Edwards said, per Reuters. \u201cWe saw that it wasn\u2019t just that we didn\u2019t make shots (in Game 1), it was more so our defensive pressure and intensity. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring it. So, we knew we had to bring it today.\u201d Kuminga had a team-high 18 points for the Warriors off the bench, while Jimmy Butler added 17 points. Trayce Jackson-Davis had 15 off the bench as Kerr used a 14-man rotation in an attempt to find a solution to Curry\u2019s absence. The Warriors said Curry has a strained left hamstring and will be reevaluated in a week, meaning he could possibly return for Game 5, which is scheduled for May 14. \u201cPart of the game plan coming in was to play a lot of people and we did,\u201d Golden State coach Kerr said, per the NBA. \u201cWe have to figure out what we\u2019re going to be able to do in this series without Steph. We gave a lot of people a lot of chances and some guys really stepped up. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out rotations and who we start, but they\u2019re going to be a part of it. We\u2019ve got to find some better ways to score.\u201d The series moves to San Francisco for Game 3 on Saturday.",

      "content": "The New York Knicks fought back from a 20-point third-quarter deficit for the second straight game against the Boston Celtics to open up a 2-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Jalen Brunson made two clutch free throws with 12.7 seconds remaining to give the Knicks a one-point lead, before Mikal Bridges made another game-winning steal, this time on Jayson Tatum, to secure a huge 91-90 win at TD Garden. Related article\nSteph Curry out for at least a week after injury in Game 1 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves Teams that win the first two games of a playoff series on the road advance to the next round 85.7% of the time, per the Associated Press. The defending champions are now in real danger of being eliminated with the next two games at a raucous Madison Square Garden. \u201cTwo games we\u2019re up 20 points (and) somehow end up not with wins is inexcusable,\u201d Boston star Jaylen Brown, who was the victim of Bridges\u2019 game-winning steal in the series opener, told reporters. \u201cObviously, being down two, it sucks. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to show what we\u2019re made of,\u201d Brown added. \u201cObviously, we wouldn\u2019t like to be in this position, but we\u2019re here now, so we got to respond.\u201d No team in the history of the NBA has shot more three-pointers than this version of the Celtics, but it has been their undoing so far in this series, going a combined 25-of-100 from deep across Games 1 and 2 \u2013 including missing a league playoff-record 45 triples in the opener. The Celtics offense crumbled in the fourth quarter, missing 14 of its final 15 shots that included an incredible run of more than eight minutes without a bucket. It has been a remarkable start to the series for a Knicks team that finished 10 games back from the No. 1 seed Celtics and got swept 4-0 in the teams\u2019 regular season matchups. Josh Hart finished with a game-high 23 points for the Knicks, while Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 17 rebounds. Brunson, the 2024-25 Clutch Player of the Year, had 17 points \u2013 including the Knicks\u2019 last six of the game \u2013 and seven assists. After shooting 0-for-8 through the first three quarters, Bridges scored all 14 of his points in the fourth before his crucial steal at the end. Bridges said after the game that the team is \u201cjust finding ways to win.\u201d For the Celtics, Derrick White and Brown had 20 points, but it was a tough night for Tatum who finished with 13 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Game 3 is at Madison Square Garden in New York on Saturday. The Oklahoma City Thunder demolished the Denver Nuggets 149-106 on Wednesday to level the series at 1-1. Oklahoma set a new NBA playoff record for points scored in a half, dropping a staggering 87 in the first half against the Nuggets. Denver, who fired longtime head coach Michael Malone just before the playoffs, snatched a win in Game 1 with a late Aaron Gordon three-pointer, but Game 2 was never even a contest as the Thunder raced out to a 24-point, first-quarter lead. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a game-high 34 points for the Thunder to go with eight assists and four rebounds, while Chet Holmgren posted a double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds. All five Thunder starters, plus three players off the bench, hit double figures in the rout. Nikola Joki\u0107, Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s rival for the MVP award, scored just 17 points and fouled out in the third quarter. The three-time MVP had a historic 42-point, 22-rebound performance in Game 1. Game 3 is in Denver on Saturday.",

      "content": "Rory McIlroy says he feels \u201ca lot less pressure\u201d as he prepares to return to major action having ended years of heartbreak with his victory at the Masters last month. The Northern Irishman was finally able to slip on the famous green jacket and enter himself into the record books \u2013 becoming the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam of winning each of golf\u2019s four majors \u2013 after prevailing at Augusta National, sparking emotional scenes of celebrations. With that monkey off his back, McIlroy returns to major action at next week\u2019s PGA Championship at Quail Hollow. And by ending an 11-year wait for his fifth major title, the 35-year-old admitted that he\u2019s going to arrive in Charlotte, North Carolina, with far fewer expectations on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure, and I\u2019m also going back to a venue that I love. It\u2019s nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened a few weeks ago and then with my history there and how well I\u2019ve played at Quail,\u201d McIlroy told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the Truist Championship in Philadelphia. \u201cIt probably will feel a little bit different. I probably won\u2019t be quite as on edge as I have been for the last few years when I\u2019ve been at major championships. I\u2019ll probably be a little bit better to be around for my family, and I\u2019ll be a little more relaxed. I think overall it will be a good thing.\u201d Related article\nRory McIlroy could go onto win 10 majors now Masters \u2018shackles are off,\u2019 says men\u2019s captain of his hometown golf club There\u2019s a reason for McIlroy to be so confident heading into the second major of 2025. He won the Truist Championship by five shots last year at Quail Hollow when it was staged there and already has gotten off to an excellent start on the PGA Tour this season with two other victories outside of his Masters triumph. This year, the tournament is being held on the Wissahickon Course at the Philadelphia Cricket Club as McIlroy seeks to defend his crown and claim his fifth Truist Championship title in the process. McIlroy said that he\u2019s cherished his time celebrating his Masters victory with friends and family, describing him and his mom being a \u201cmess for a few minutes\u201d when they first saw each other afterwards. \u201cLook, as an only child, I have a bond,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky, and I know a lot of people feel this, that they have a close bond with their parents, but I think as time goes on and I\u2019m getting a little older, I realize that they\u2019re not going to be around forever. It means even more that they were still around to be able to see me complete the slam and fulfill those dreams.\u201d But he admitted he\u2019s also enjoyed returning to the day job having stepped back into competitive action at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last week. \u201cGood to be here. First week, I guess, as an individual coming back and playing over the last few weeks. I\u2019m excited to get back to being a golfer,\u201d the world No. 2 said.",
