      "content": "Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism, as Karl Matchett reports I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The mood around UK business has ranged from cautious to desperate in the past few months as the economy battles inflation, tax grabs, rising labour costs and the prospects of US tariffs. Add in constant political pressures giving a bleak outlook and the stock market plummeting in early April on the back of those tariffs, and UK plc could be forgiven for thinking 2025 might become a year to forget. But perhaps all is not as bad as it was beginning to appear, with some important signs giving relief and optimism to some businesses who got a share price backing boost thanks to the world\u2019s biggest investor, BlackRock, building stakes in multiple companies. And the most imminent boost will be a cut to interest rates. The Bank of England meets on 8 May and a 0.25 per cent cut appears all but guaranteed at this stage. And back-to-back rates cuts are entirely possible, bringing the Bank Rate down to 4 per cent by summer. It would be the first time since March 2023 that the interest rate returns to that level, easing costs for business owners with debt and perhaps allowing more consideration to investment on projects and other spending which could spark opportunities for the growth the economy desperately needs. Some businesses already look well-positioned to capture that growth, believes Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock. \u201c[The company has] allocated more capital back to the UK tactically now with the belief that in the short run, the new administration is trying to tackle some of the hard issues,\u201d Mr Fink toldThe Times. \u201cI think the prime minister is articulating the needs of what we have to do. I have more confidence in the UK economy today than I did a year ago.\u201d Pointing to some of the financial institutions that had seen their share price hammered this year as the FTSE 100 dropped along with other major stock markets, Mr Fink explained how BlackRock had taken stakes in different sectors in the belief the selloff was overdone. \u201cSo many of the UK stocks discounts were too deep, especially like in the banking system. Look at the rebound in the valuations of NatWest and Lloyds and how they bounced. We added to our positions across the board with the idea that we believe the market was discounting too much negativity. And we believe the negativity was probably not warranted,\u201d he said. Having seen a significant drop from 3 April onwards, the FTSE 100 - the biggest firms on the London Stock Exchange - have bounced back somewhat and now remain up more than two per cent since the start of 2025, even if they have collectively not reached March\u2019s high points. Interest rate drops - while affecting households in terms of mortgages, savings accounts and so on - also impact investing. That is in part due to lower guaranteed returns from cash or like-cash holdings, meaning more risk may be taken on in the form of stock market equities. Rising share prices help improve investor and business confidence, while consumers may then benefit from having more money in their own pockets if rate drops mean they pay less on mortgages and other debt. There are further positives in other sectors. Retail sales rose almost half a percent in the UK during March, and that came ahead of April when the rise to minimum wage kicked in meaning more money in some workers\u2019 pockets. Jacqui Baker, head of retail at RSM UK, said: \u201cGlimpses of warmer weather and improving consumer confidence meant retail sales continued its upward trend in March. Sales volumes rose for the third consecutive month, reaching their highest level since July 2022. The first quarter of 2025 suggests consumer spending is slowly starting to return, which should provide some reason for optimism in the retail sector.\u201d Then there\u2019s analysis from Barclays, showing both wage growth easing and contraction in employment. Both of these factors will further ease pressure on the Bank of England when it comes to deciding rates cuts. Small wins they might seem, and with little impact of individuals, but as we so often see in businesses, it\u2019s those small wins adding up continuously which lead to the potential to outperform. Awful April might just be closing with reason to face May and beyond with a more careful measure of optimism.

      "content": "A 71 per cent drop in profits and tanking share price have forced Elon Musk to cut down his time as Trump\u2019s costcutter-in-chief. Alicja Hagopian and Karl Matchett explore what happened I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice At the start of the year, Tesla\u2019s share price was at an all-time high. Elon Musk, owner of the electric vehicle giant, was coasting on the win of his ally Donald Trump, and investors were hedging their bets that soon-to-be-President Trump would enact policies in favour of Tesla and the billionaire\u2019s other companies. But with an astronomical fall in share price, tanking sales and shrinking profits, the reality for Tesla has been far different \u2013 and much of it is tied to Musk\u2019s public-facing role in the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tesla stock once made up the majority of Musk\u2019s wealth, but now it is reporting huge drops in profit. The decision to step away from DOGE may show that Musk is not immune to Tesla\u2019s downfall. Within one month of Musk\u2019s appointment to DOGE, Tesla shares were down 16.5 per cent. Within two, Tesla\u2019s share price was down 45 per cent from when Trump came into office. And Musk himself has lost an estimated $149 billion in wealth since taking the helm at DOGE; at $301 billion compared to $449 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index. Tesla\u2019s share price problems have been far from cosmetic. The business is facing significant headwinds, not least because of the intertwined reputation with its notorious leader. In January and February, Tesla sales in Europe saw sudden dips, of 45 per cent and 39 per cent respectively year-on-year - despite steady growth in the European electric vehicle (EV) market. The numbers behind this week\u2019s latest earnings reports are, as expected, not pretty. Quarterly profits of $409m contrasted starkly with last year\u2019s $1.4bn figure for the same three months - and the 71 per cent drop represents the company\u2019s lowest quarterly profits since 2020. Actual vehicle sales reported this month were down 13 per cent to a little over a third of a million across the January to March quarter, with notable declines in China and parts of the US, while revenue of $19.3bn fell short of forecasts by more than $2bn and operating margins fell to 2.1 per cent. \u201cEarnings margin of 2.1 per cent is the lowest since Tesla approached break-even in 2019,\u201d said Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot. \u201cFree cash flow dipped to $660 million, but did not enter negative territory as capital expenditures were nearly halved compared to the prior year due to reduced investments. \u201cTesla has [also] effectively removed its growth guidance for this year, no longer promising a return to growth in 2025.\u201d Additional factors affecting sales include competition from China\u2019s BYD (Build Your Dreams), which undercuts Tesla on price, while frequent recalls of Tesla vehicles may also be doing little to boost confidence in the brand. But it is impossible to ignore a major factor impacting its brand: Musk\u2019s growing unpopularity. Musk has made no secret of his increasingly controversial political viewpoints. From accusations of a nazi salute at the inauguration, to criticising Volodmyr Zelensky as \u201cevil\u201d over the war in Ukraine, it is easy to see how his actions have ruffled feathers. As a result, a string of attacks have targeted Teslas in Europe and the US over the past few months, with clear anti-Musk messages. Tesla owners have faced threats to sell their cars over \u201cNazi Extremism\u201d in California, while even in the UK, campaign groups have applied pressure against Tesla cars and charging points. Tesla shareholders are pushing back against Musk\u2019s alignment with Trump; his decision to step partly away from DOGE indicates Musk is likely feeling the blowback himself. Investors may have hoped that Musk\u2019s role in the administration would see carveouts for Tesla in Trump\u2019s trade war. But in fact, the electric vehicle brand is far from immune. Tesla manufactures its electric vehicles in the US, which makes it less exposed to 25 per cent automotive tariffs than foreign brands. But the tariffs are not just on finished cars; there is also a 25 per cent levy on all imported automotive parts, and Tesla relies on many parts imported from China, in addition to Mexico and Canada: the company is dependent on imported lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to fuel its EVs, in particular using Chinese manufacturer CATL to supply its factories. And China\u2019s new restrictions on rare earth minerals and magnets have also impacted other projects from Tesla such as its Optimus humanoid robots. With Tesla dependent on batteries and rare earth products from China, the trade war will inevitably hit its supply chain. Following Tesla\u2019s plummeting profits, it might have been expected that the share price could drop further - but the opposite has happened. On Tuesday, the share price had risen 4.6 per cent; following the announcement of Mr Musk\u2019s intentions to resume greater oversight of corporate rather than Capitol Hill activities, that trajectory continued. Tesla shares are up more than seven per cent in pre-trading, set to open well above $250 per share - still a far cry from December\u2019s peak. Lowered expectations can explain part of it, as well as a broader desire from investors to see a bull run resume - from lower share price starting points. \u201cTesla\u2019s first-quarter delivery and production numbers were as ugly as its Cybertruck design. That meant expectations were rock-bottom in the run-up to its financial results and it\u2019s why the shares didn\u2019t tank upon release of the Q1 earnings,\u201d noted Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell. \u201cCertain individuals are spotting an opportunity and might take the view that Tesla\u2019s significant share price decline has gone too far - they\u2019re buying on the dip, hoping for a bounce-back and might view the recent sell-off as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pick up shares in a previous stock market darling on the cheap. After all, the fundamentals still give bulls something to get excited about.\u201d Not everyone is quite as excited about those humanoid robots, self-driving taxis and energy storage products though. \u201cWhile Tesla is making progress on these initiatives, we believe the market and management commentary are overly optimistic about the timing. The narrative around Tesla\u2019s stock and valuation remains heavily dependent on these future prospects,\u201d Valechha cautioned. It should also be noted, the uptick isn\u2019t totally down to Tesla, Musk or anything to do with electrification - Trump\u2019s China tariff climbdown has sent the S&P 500 two per cent higher in pre-trading, with the likes of Amazon and Nvidia up four per cent each. Market volatility comes as standard in this second Trump term, and for Tesla which inadvertently became a crossover company to the political arena, that continues to go double.

      "content": "I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The Bank of England has cut interest rates to its lowest level for two years as it warned an escalating global trade war will drag on growth over the next three years. The central bank cut the UK\u2019s base interest rate from 4.5% to 4.25% following a slowdown in inflation in recent months. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said: \u201cInflationary pressures have continued to ease so we\u2019ve been able to cut rates again today.\u201d Five members of the Bank\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee voted for the 0.25 percentage point cut. Two members voted to hold rates at 4.5%, while a further two called for a sharp cut to 4%. The Bank also predicted the UK economy will grow by 1% this year, upgrading its previous 0.75% forecast on the back of a strong start to 2025. However, on Thursday it cut its UK growth forecast to 1.25% for 2026, from 1.5% in its February projections. It said recently announced US tariff plans and their impact on global trade will dent UK growth by 0.3 percentage points over the next three years. Most of this impact is set to come from \u201clower US demand for UK exports\u201d and weaker global activity, according to the Bank\u2019s latest report. It added that increased \u201cuncertainty\u201d over the trade policy is also likely to contribute to the downward impact on UK growth. The forecasts were based on tariff policy from the end of April, factoring in a 10% US tariff rate on most UK exports to the country, as well as a 25% tariff on cars and steel. However, the predictions come hours ahead of an announcement from President Donald Trump which is widely expected to unveil a trade deal between the UK and US. Meanwhile, UK inflation is predicted to witness a shallower rise than previously expected. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is on track to peak at 3.5% in the third quarter of this year, on the back of rising energy prices. However, this is a reduction on its previous guidance that inflation would peak at 3.7%. Inflation is also due to come back down to the 2% target rate set by the Government and Bank of England by the first quarter of 2027, ahead of its previous forecast. Nevertheless, Bank officials signalled higher trade tariffs are likely to push UK inflation down by \u201c0.2 percentage points in two years\u2019 time\u201d. Weaker global trade activity and reduced US demand for exports are expected to contribute to the drop in inflation, according to the report. It also highlighted however multinational firms could change their pricing in the UK in order to help deal with the impact of \u201chigher costs in other jurisdictions\u201d. The Bank has also predicted it will cut interest rates at a faster rate than previously expected, amid the backdrop of potentially shallower inflation and slower growth next year. It has said interest rates are predicted to fall as low as 3.5% by the second quarter of next year, indicating a further three cuts by rate-setters. Meanwhile, UK unemployment is also predicted to rise over the next two years, as businesses face uncertainty over trade tensions and the recent increase in wages and national insurance contributions. The unemployment rate is set to peak at 5% next year and stay at this level in 2027, according to the new forecasts. The Bank previously predicted it would rise to a high of 4.8%.",

      "content": "Following cuts in February and now May, the base rate is down from a high of 5.25 per cent to a level last seen two years ago in May 2023 I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The Bank of England has confirmed a 25 basis points cut to the Bank Rate down to 4.25 per cent, a second such drop this year in an ongoing boost to businesses and mortgage payers alike. Following cuts in February and now May, the base rate is down from a high of 5.25 per cent to a level last seen two years ago in May 2023. While the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had been widely expected to bring interest rate down this time, there is a wider possibility for back-to-back rate cuts - while some analysts predict a further three cuts to happen this year, bringing the interest rate down below four per cent for the first time since January 2023. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said: \"Inflationary pressures have continued to ease so we've been able to cut rates again today.\" The Bank also predicted that the UK economy will grow by 1 per cent this year, upgrading its previous 0.75 per cent forecast on the back of a strong start to 2025. However, it added that recently announced US tariff plans and their impact on global trade will dent UK growth by 0.3 percentage points over the next three years, as it downgraded its 2026 forecast. Most of this downward impact is to come from \"lower US demand for UK exports\" and weaker global activity, according to the Bank's latest report. Nathan Emerson, chief executive of Propertymark, said: \"Today's news will no doubt be extremely welcome for many, especially given current economic uncertainties. International bodies have recently stated they expect interest rates to fall in the UK as the year progresses. Overall, we hope to see interest rates further continue their downward trajectory over the course of 2025. \"The UK housing market has recently been buoyed by Stamp Duty threshold changes leading up to the start of April, and with the busier spring and summer months now here, this base rate reduction should attract even more buyers and sellers to the market and provide greater affordability. \"Housing is a central part of the UK economy, and we now hope to see considering the UK Government and the devolved administrations have shown a keen focus on housing growth, is that they look ahead to achieving their individual housebuilding targets to meet growing demand.\" Businesses habitually look to invest more money in projects or personnel when interest rates are lower, as the cost of taking on debt is in turn lower. Theo Chatha, CFO of Bibby Financial Services, pointed out that more than six in ten smaller businesses (62 per cent) have said they\u2019d \u201cfeel more confident investing\u201d with lower rates - but cautioned against potential future interest rate rises if the UK faces inflationary pressures as a result of Trump tariffs. \u201cThe Bank may need to raise rates again later in the year to curb inflation due to tariffs friction,\u201d he said. \u201cThis threatens to dampen SMEs\u2019 ambition \u2013 meaning investment plans are delayed further, but SMEs can\u2019t afford a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach to decision making. Against economic uncertainty, businesses that continue to invest and plan for every scenario will stay ahead of the competition.\u201d While this interest rate cut was already largely priced into mortgage markets, the possibility of future interest rate cuts should still see more competitive product rates emerging in the months ahead. Plenty of lenders are already fighting a sub-four per cent battle, a relief to any of those homeowners set to come to the end of a fixed term across the coming months. On the other hand, while loans will also become cheaper to pay off if not linked to fixed interest rates, any cash held in variable rate savings accounts could soon be earning less.

      "content": "President Donald Trump said he would make a significant trade announcement Thursday with the United Kingdom, yet another sign of some possible relief from historically high tariffs that have threatened serious damage to the US and global economies. \u201cBig News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!\u201d Trump posted Wednesday night on Truth Social. Trump said the deal with the UK would be substantial. \u201cThe agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\u201d Trump said in a subsequent post Thursday morning. \u201cBecause of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\u201d \u201cThis should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom,\u201d he said in a separate message. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he will make a statement about the outcome of trade talks with the United States later on Thursday. Speaking at a conference in London, he said: \u201cTalks with the US have been ongoing and you\u2019ll hear more from me about that later today.\u201d Trump\u2019s administration has previously suggested it is in active negotiations with India, the UK, South Korea and Japan. Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told CNN Tuesday that he suspected the UK may be the first country to sign a trade agreement with the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be the UK first or India first, it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019ve got a little twist in the India story, so that might slow things down there, but I can assure the American people that there will be deals, and they will be very good deals for the American people,\u201d Navarro said. Related article\nThe Bank of England cuts interest rates as tariffs endanger global economic growth The Financial Times on Tuesday reported that a UK trade deal could be signed this week and could exempt the United States from some non-tariff trade barriers, including the UK\u2019s 2% digital services tax charged to US technology companies. In exchange, the United States may ease the tariff burden on the UK, perhaps reducing or exempting the country from 25% tariffs on aluminum, steel and autos, the FT reported. For weeks, Trump officials have said they are talking to more than a dozen countries and are nearing a deal, but none have been announced so far. Trump has frequently said he is in no rush to sign a deal, claiming that countries have been \u201cripping off\u201d America for years and the high tariffs the United States has imposed will help balance trade. Financial markets cheered the news of a deal. Dow futures rose nearly 400 points, or 0.9%. The broader S&P 500 futures were up 1.1%, and Nasdaq futures were 1.5% higher. The FTSE 100 rose 0.3% after the trade news and a rate-cut announcement from the Bank of England earlier in the day Thursday. Despite the administration\u2019s rhetoric that it is in advanced trade negotiations with more than a dozen countries, actual trade deals take significant time, often years, to hash out. They typically involve incredibly complex agreements, delving into the minutiae of various goods and non-tariff barriers. They often involve significant political considerations, as various parties seek to protect voters with special interests. Instead, the \u201cdeal\u201d Trump teased is more likely a memorandum of understanding. That may result in lower tariffs on one particular country\u2019s goods in the near term, but they\u2019ll do little that amounts to a substantial economic win for quite some time. \u201cThis is expected to be a \u2018heads of terms\u2019 agreement which sets the broad contours of the arrangement,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Allan Monks wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \u201cThe full details are yet to be determined bilaterally and will follow further negotiations\u201d JPMorgan said the scope of the deal appears limited, because US tariffs on the UK are expected to remain higher than they were before Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement on April 2. The economic benefit to the United Kingdom will be small, Monks said. And this is just a single agreement. Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that went into effect April 7 and were paused for 90 days on April 9 affect dozens of countries. A hundred or so more are subject to the 10% universal tariff. The administration can\u2019t possibly get those all done by July 8. \u201cThe 90-day tariff pause, which is now roughly 25% over, provides little time for the typical back-and-forth trade discussions that require months if not years to craft a trade deal,\u201d said Jacob Jensen, trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute. \u201cThere is a significant difference if these deals are official, written trade agreements rather than verbal commitments to buy more US products, as one has long-term economic implications and the other can be ignored down the line,\u201d he added. Related article\nKey takeaways from the Fed\u2019s latest decision to hold rates steady as it warns of stagflation Trump said last month he would not extend the tariffs a second time \u2014 and, in fact, may act sooner to reinstate some tariffs for countries with whom his administration cannot reach an agreement, perhaps in a matter of a couple weeks. \u201cIt will be difficult for the US trade representative to negotiate potentially 100 separate trade agreements within 90 days, meaning President Trump must soon determine whether tariffs will be reinstated or delayed further,\u201d Jensen said. And even if deals are ultimately completed with all countries, there\u2019s no guarantee Trump would keep them. For example, Trump, in his first term, was instrumental in negotiating the USMCA free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, only to abandon it in his second term, charging an on-again, off-again 25% tariff on some Mexican and Canadian goods. And by placing significant tariffs on virtually all goods coming into the United States, Trump also blew up a number of existing trade deals with allies. Trump\u2019s announcement of a trade deal is the second significant sign this week that the administration may be open to negotiations that would ultimately lower some tariffs on foreign nations. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will both travel to Geneva, Switzerland, where they will meet their Chinese counterparts. Although Bessent told Fox News not to expect a major trade deal from the meetings, he acknowledged it was an important step in negotiations and could de-escalate tensions that have led the United States to place at least a 145% tariff on most Chinese goods. In turn, China has placed a 125% tariff on US goods. Trump, however, on Wednesday said he would not lower the high tariffs on China in advance of discussions, which Beijing has previously said was a pre-condition for talks. When asked in the Oval Office whether he was open to pulling back the historically high tariffs to get China to the negotiating table, Trump replied simply with: \u201cNo.\u201d Nevertheless, any thaw in the trade war could be a welcome sign for businesses and consumers in both countries and around the globe. The punishing tariffs have already damaged economies around the world \u2014 particularly America\u2019s. The US economy went into reverse in the first quarter, its first contraction in three years, as businesses stockpiled goods in anticipation of Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, which began in the second quarter. Related article\nThe first boats carrying Chinese goods with 145% tariffs are arriving in LA. Shipments are cut in half. Expect shortages soon Although the China-US trade standoff is by far the most aggressive, Trump has imposed large tariffs on most other countries around the world too: a 10% universal tariff on virtually all goods entering the United States, plus 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, auto parts and some goods from Mexico and Canada. So the world will be watching Thursday\u2019s announcement and the US-China talks this weekend with anticipation. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said at a press conference that tariffs could do serious damage to America\u2019s economy. But he said the trade talks the United States is holding with foreign countries could prevent the worst-case scenario. Global economists at the International Monetary Fund, OECD and World Bank have all predicted that Trump\u2019s trade war would have disastrous effects on the global economy, slowing growth dramatically in some countries, while reigniting inflation. Many US economists and large banks predict the United States could enter a recession this year. This story has been updated with additional developments and context.

The president\u2019s tit-for-tat trade war is already weighing on American businesses and consumers. The Fed on Wednesday held rates steady for the third time in a row, waiting for Trump\u2019s policies to show up more clearly in economic data. But the central bank\u2019s latest policy statement noted that the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation has risen. At a news conference that same day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that stagflation \u2014 the combination of stagnant growth and higher inflation \u2014 would put the central bank in a difficult situation. But Fed officials, including Powell on Wednesday, have hinted that they\u2019ll respond quickly to any whiff of a weakening labor market, as they did last year, even if there\u2019s a tariff-induced rise in inflation. \u201cWhen the Fed starts to see the unemployment rate rise and nonfarm payrolls start to crack, they\u2019re going to prioritize the employment side,\u201d Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN. Fed officials have said there\u2019s good reason to believe any inflation induced by tariffs might be temporary. \u201cInflation could rise starting in a few months and then move back down toward our target possibly as early as by the end of this year. Yes, I am saying that I expect that elevated inflation would be temporary,\u201d Christopher Waller, who is on the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors, said on April 14 at an event in St. Louis, Missouri. But even if inflation rises only temporarily, \u201cthe effects on output and employment could be longer-lasting and an important factor in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy,\u201d he said. But St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem warned in a speech in late March that the Fed should be \u201cwary of assuming that the impact of tariff increases on inflation will be entirely temporary.\u201d Related article\nThe Fed leaves its key interest rate as is. Here\u2019s how you can benefit Inflation could stick around and become a bigger problem if people lose faith that price increases will go back to normal or if there are supply-chain disruptions. However, a weakening job market could very well undo upward pressure on prices. \u201cAny sign of growing slack in the jobs market would give the Fed some reassurance that inflationary pressures will subside, and give them room to offer more support to the economy with rate cuts,\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. In April, the US economy added a stronger-than-expected 177,000 jobs as the unemployment rate held steady at a low 4.2%. But hiring trends could change, as recession fears and high levels of economic uncertainty loom. \u201cMany firms (in the Boston Fed\u2019s district) planned to pause or limit hiring going forward because of policy uncertainty,\u201d according to the central bank\u2019s latest Beige Book report, a periodic collection of survey responses from businesses across the country. Trump\u2019s tariffs have already weighed on economic growth. Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, fell in the beginning of the year in its first quarterly decline since 2022. Americans had rushed to buy products ahead of the tariffs, sending imports surging and far outpacing exports. Last year, the Fed showed it\u2019s highly sensitive to a weakening labor market. In September, the central bank delivered a bold half-point cut after unemployment climbed for a few months and employers downshifted job growth. It turned out that the job market was just softening, but Fed officials still responded swiftly. \u201cThe Fed surprised everyone with that 50 basis-point cut,\u201d Cervi said. \u201cJerome Powell, in my opinion, is a bit more dovish than not, and we think that that that will likely prevail here.\u201d \u201cDovish\u201d is a term that refers to when a Fed official is more concerned with preventing any undue damage to the economy or the labor market. Powell, in Wednesday\u2019s news conference, defended that jumbo rate cut, saying \u201cit was a really obvious concern\u201d at the time. \u201cThe unemployment rate went up by almost a full percentage point, and it was click, click, click, click, click each month, and everywhere people were talking about downside risks to the labor market,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there for inflation for a couple of years and we wanted to show also that we\u2019re there for the labor market, and it\u2019s important that we sent that signal,\u201d he said.",

The president wants to make two things clear: His tariffs are the most important reordering of global trade the world has ever seen. And his tariffs are not that big of a deal, if you\u2019re man enough. It\u2019s just one of the many manosphere-coded talking points coming out of the White House and its right-wing media fans to defend radical tariffs that Trump claims will revive rugged, traditionally male-dominated jobs in factories. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, between rounds of congressional testimony, went on Fox News \u2014 where hosts have spun Trump\u2019s tariffs as the \u201cultimate testosterone boost\u201d \u2014 to reiterate Trump\u2019s suddenly very pronounced opinions about the appropriate number of toys children should have. Trump probably wasn\u2019t supposed to admit on camera that his signature economic policy would cause prices to go up. But rather than spin it, Trump and Co. have doubled down. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old girl, doesn\u2019t need 37 dolls,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. Earlier, he told NBC News\u2019 Kristen Welker: \u201cI don\u2019t think that a beautiful baby girl needs \u2014 that\u2019s 11 years old \u2014 needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable.\u201d But the administration\u2019s emphasis on toys for girls is no gaffe. It is an attempt at misdirection that\u2019s squarely in line with the MAGA right\u2019s obsession with traditional, binary gender expressions. \u201cThe reason they keep using dolls as their example is because they\u2019re trying to frame caring about material stuff as feminine and thus inherently shameful,\u201d wrote Leah Greenberg, co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive organizing group Indivisible, on Bluesky. By focusing on dolls and girls, Trump\u2019s message of austerity becomes less about sacrificing for his trade war and morphs into more of a taunt: \u201cWhat are you afraid of, your kid won\u2019t have dolls to play with?\u201d And it conveniently leaves out all the other essentials \u2014 clothes, cars, homebuilding materials, fruits and vegetables \u2014 that will become scarcer or more expensive on his watch. Related article\nThe White House billionaires have no idea how Americans live (and don\u2019t seem to care) On Fox Tuesday, Bessent took the point further. To any kids who are sad about getting fewer dolls, Bessent would say: \u201cYou will have a better life than your parents\u201d and \u201cyour family will own a home\u201d because of the \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d Trump is creating. Ah, yes, the freedom to work in a factory, despite most Americans saying they do not want to work in a factory. Even some Republican lawmakers are getting annoyed with all the doll discourse. According to The Hill, GOP members of Congress who have been largely in lockstep with Trump are grumbling behind closed doors that the message of sacrifice comes off as out of touch. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to see why the \u201ctwo dolls\u201d line is falling flat, coming from some of the wealthiest officials in American in history. Bessent is a Yale grad who amassed his multimillion-dollar fortune on Wall Street. And Trump is a crypto-peddling hotel-and-casino mogul who\u2019s planning to spend untold amounts of taxpayer money on a military parade for his birthday next month. Is that something a 78-year-old man needs?",

      "content": "The number of Washington, DC area homeowners who decided to list their homes for sale jumped last month amid steep cuts to the federal workforce. In the four weeks ending April 27, the number of active home listings in the nation\u2019s capital surged 25.1% year-over-year, the largest gain on record, according to a new report from real estate website Redfin. The jump in DC homes for sale outpaced active listings nationwide, which grew 14.2% in that same period, Redfin said. Active listings in DC are now at their highest level since 2022, according to the report. The uptick in new homes for sale in DC comes amid steep layoffs in the federal workforce, driven by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has slashed federal funding and jobs in an attempt to reduce government spending. Redfin found that active listings are rising fastest in the suburbs of DC, where many federal workers live. Homes for sale in Alexandria, Virginia, jumped nearly 41% year-over-year during the four weeks ending April 27, the largest increase of the surrounding counties Redfin analyzed. Montgomery County, Maryland, saw new home listings surge 38.5%, and Loudoun County, Virginia, also saw a surge of 36.8%. Real estate agents in the DC area told CNN the housing market is still relatively tight, though, despite the high number of recent home listings. \u201cWhile there are notable government layoffs contributing to some new listings, we\u2019re not witnessing a mass exodus,\u201d Candyce Astroth, a Realtor based in Fairfax, Virginia said. \u201cThe housing crisis persists, and we still need more listings to meet the demand in the market.\u201d However, Brian Coester, a Realtor based in Maryland, said that the DC area feels \u201cdifferent than it\u2019s been in a long time in the sense of the uncertainty around some of the administration changes.\u201d According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government shed 9,000 jobs in April and has lost 26,000 workers since January. However, the true number is likely much larger. For example, workers who accepted DOGE\u2019s offer of a \u201cbuyout\u201d in January will not show up in federal unemployment data because they are technically still on the federal government\u2019s payroll through September. According to a CNN analysis of official statements and internal memos, at least 121,000 federal workers were laid off or targeted for layoffs in President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. Federal workers make up the highest proportion of the workforce in DC compared to any US state, with federal jobs constituting more than 13% of total employment, according to a March report from the Economic Policy Institute. Maryland and Virginia, states that surround DC, have the second- and third-highest shares, at 7.3% and 5.6%, respectively.",

      "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs regime has disrupted markets, darkened the outlook for employers and businesses and hammered consumer sentiment. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important than ever to take control of what you can financially. That can start with making sure your savings are earning the best returns possible and are parked in the right types of accounts, given your needs and time horizon. Related article\nThe Fed holds interest rates steady again as the US economy slows on Trump\u2019s tariffs Since the Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided not to lower its key overnight lending rate, which affects interest rates throughout the economy, you can still earn a very healthy yield on your cash. That\u2019s good news since economists believe inflation \u2014 which came in at 2.3% in March \u2013 will be going up this year as a result of the tariffs. By how much? Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace he expects both headline and core inflation to top 4% later this year. So you\u2019ll want to look for returns on your cash that can match or beat that expectation. For money you\u2019re setting aside for emergencies or for near-term but not immediate cash-flow needs, consider using: FDIC-insured online high-yield savings accounts: Having a checking and savings account at one of the big brick-and-mortar banks is great for money needed to pay monthly bills, groceries and other everyday expenses. But for other money you want at the ready for less regular expenses, you\u2019ll get a much better rate in a high-yield savings account at an online FDIC-insured bank. All bank savings rates are variable \u2014 so will fall if the Fed lowers its benchmark rate later this year. But, for now, many of the highest-yielding online savings accounts are paying between 4% and 4.4%, versus roughly 0.1% at the biggest banks like Chase, according to Bankrate.com. FDIC-insured online money market accounts: Another online banking option that pays very competitively are money market accounts. \u201cThe average MMA yield at brick-and-mortar banks is a scant 0.41%, whereas the top-yielding, nationally available MMAs offered by online banks pay 10 times that amount, 4.1% or more. Ten times the return, while still being fully covered by federal deposit insurance and (offering you) access to the money when it is needed,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst. For money you\u2019ve set aside for down-the-line expenses like a down payment or a year or more of living expenses if you\u2019re retiring soon, you can lock in advantageous rates now through: Treasuries: Treasury bills come in six different maturities, ranging from four to 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven and 10 years. If you buy one and hold it to maturity, you will lock in a rate of return that is higher than inflation while also preserving your principal. If you want to know how much you\u2019ll make by holding it to maturity, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to beat,\u201d said Ken Robinson, an Ohio-based certified financial planner who is part of Wealthramp, a network of experienced, fee-only advisers. As of Tuesday evening on Schwab.com, Treasury bills were offering average yields ranging from a low of 3.88% to a high of 4.33%, while Treasury note yields ranged from 3.78% to 4.28%. Interest paid on Treasuries is exempt from state and local income taxes, so may be a good option if you live in a high-tax area. Know, though, that if you sell a Treasury before it matures, that can trigger a capital gain or loss on the price you get for it. Related article\nMunicipal bond yields offer attractive returns for individual investors. Could Congress kill their tax advantage? AAA-rated municipal bonds: The tax advantages of high-quality municipal bonds are particularly favorable for those in high-tax states, and especially people in the top income tax brackets. The interest you earn on munis, which are issued by state and local governments, is exempt from federal income tax. It also may be exempt from state and local taxes if you buy one issued by your home state. \u201c(Highly rated muni bonds) have a supremely strong record of paying what they\u2019re supposed to when they\u2019re supposed to,\u201d Robinson said. As with Treasuries, he noted, the key to getting the most out of a municipal bond is to hold it to maturity. Certificates of deposit: CDs from FDIC-insured banks are a reliable place to park money that you can afford to lock up for a fixed period. For instance, CDs with maturation periods ranging from 3 months to five years were all offering average yields over 4% on Schwab.com. A good number of individual one-year CDs were offering a return between 4.5% and 5%. Keep in mind, earnings on a CD are subject to federal, state and local income taxes. In addition, if you buy a CD direct from a bank, you may pay an early withdrawal penalty if you cash it out before maturity, although such a penalty will be tax deductible. If you buy a so-called \u201cbrokered\u201d CD on a brokerage platform \u2014 which offers you a much wider range of CDs to choose from \u2014 you might lose money on your principal if you don\u2019t hold it to maturity and instead sell it into the secondary market at less than you bought it for, Robinson noted. Money market mutual funds: Money market mutual funds are currently averaging 4.14%, according to Crane Data, with some funds paying close to 4.4%. Unlike with fixed-rate bonds, Treasuries or CDs, you can\u2019t lock in a rate of return with a money market fund. But it\u2019s an easy, one-stop shop to park money that will always get the best cash yields on offer. Money market funds, which invest in government and corporate debt securities, are considered low-risk investments that usually maintain a price of $1 a share, although there have been a few times when they \u201cbroke the buck\u201d and traded below $1 a share. If the fund invests in top-rated municipal securities issued by your home state, your returns may be tax-free. Unlike money market accounts, money market mutual funds are not federally insured. There is nothing encouraging to say about interest rates on debt other than at least the Fed didn\u2019t choose to raise rates, which would make your prospects for finding an affordable loan worse. That said, how you manage your debt is ultimately way more important than any move the Fed makes. Credit cards: Even if the Fed were to make dramatic rate cuts, the interest you pay to borrow money on a credit card likely will remain sky-high. In fact, the average credit card rate actually rose to 20.12% as of April 30 from 20.09% the week before, according to Bankrate.com. The best thing you can do if you carry high-rate credit card debt is to see if you can get a 0% balance transfer card, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. That will buy you up to 21 months interest free, during which time you can direct as much money as you can to paying down your balance. Mortgages: As of May 1, interest rates on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.76%, according to Freddie Mac. That\u2019s 0.05 points lower than the prior week, and just under half a point below the 7.22% average recorded around May 1 last year. \u201cFor those shopping for a home this summer, rates are likely to stay in or around (the 6.6% to 7%) range in the near future. Even a rate cut from the Fed may not send mortgage rates lower, as the Fed doesn\u2019t impact mortgage rates directly the way they do with credit cards,\u201d Schulz said. Car loans: Financing a car purchase is always a little complex. But the math is harder now. \u201cToday\u2019s car shoppers are contending with the difficult duo of elevated vehicle costs and high borrowing rates,\u201d said Joseph Yoon, a consumer insights analyst at Edmunds.com. \u201cAdding to this scenario is the ambiguity surrounding tariff repercussions on vehicle supply and, consequently, their price tags, forcing buyers to navigate an ever-more complicated shopping path.\u201d In April the average amount financed for a new car rose  about $400 to $41,444 at 7.1% interest over 69 months, with an average monthly payment of $744, according to data from Edmunds.com. For used cars, the average loan amount was up about $600 to $28,855 at 10.9% over 69.5 months, with an average monthly payment of $555. Yoon\u2019s advice: Be really clear what your needs are for a new car versus your wants \u2014 including things like size and desired features. Then shop around for the best deals and carefully compare loan offers. To help with the math, Edmunds.com has a car loan interest calculator.",

      "content": "Jen MeierhansBusiness reporter As we've been reporting this morning, the US and UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs later - described by Trump as a \"major trade deal\". It won't be a free-trade agreement, which has to be cleared by Congress. What is announced today is likely to be only the bare bones of a narrow agreement. Here's a look at what it could contain: Cars will be important Steel and aluminium pact Pharmaceuticals are a big unknown Digital services tax olive branch Food standards will not be included Read our full story here. Faisal IslamEconomics editor The key diplomatic win is that an agreement on tariffs will keep the US sweet while leaving the door open to a deal with Europe - which would be much more economically significant for the UK. Economically, this US deal is likely to be relatively small. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the rolling back of some of the trade damage done by Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original announcement. In contrast, the EU is the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest trading partner. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was clear about it being a priority when I interviewed her recently, suggesting that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. Liv McMahonTechnology reporter It is rumoured that the British government will reduce its tax on US digital services as part of the deal to reduce tariffs. The digital services tax was introduced in April 2020 under the  then Conservative government, with the aim of making overseas tech firms accountable for financial value contributed by UK users. It charges businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces a flat 2% rate tax on revenues derived from UK users. Firms only have to pay it if they raise more than \u00c2\u00a3500m in global revenues and \u00c2\u00a325m from UK users annually. But this is a threshold easily met by US tech titans, such as Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon, raising billions annually worldwide each year. The UK reportedly, external netted nearly \u00c2\u00a3360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year. Of course, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually know whether it is set to be narrowed until the US-UK tariffs agreement is unveiled this afternoon. In weighing up whether to make the concession, the UK will have had to consider several competing pressures - such as its drive to raise revenue and further growth with the political risk of being seen to concede to big tech, or President Trump. Donald Trump has just posted again on Truth Social and says: \"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honour to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\" Dharshini DavidDeputy economics editor British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover announced it was pausing shipments in April due to the impact of Trump's tariffs. The potential tariff pact could offer considerable relief to the car and pharmaceuticals industries - but may not significantly shift the dial for British economic growth. The industries at the heart of discussions make up less than a third of the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exports of goods to the US, the total value of those equal to less than 1% of GDP. The baseline 10% universal tariff on most goods sold into the US seems set to remain. Moreover, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the UK may have to surrender in return for these concessions - including revenues raised by the digital devices tax. The UK-India deal agreed earlier this week may only bump up our GDP by 0.1% - a US tariff pact may be less significant. Nonetheless, smoothing things over in this key relationship -and being first in line for such a pact - is of huge symbolic importance for the UK in the new global trade (dis)order. Trump has just said today should be \"a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom,\" in a post on Truth Social. The US president reiterates that there will be a news conference at the Oval Office at 10:00 local time (15:00 BST). Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in April \"the global economy will suffer\" after Trump imposed tariffs It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inevitable that some politicians will point to Brexit as helping make today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s US-UK trade agreement possible. Whatever is in the agreement in the coming hours, we will see a clear difference in the way President Donald Trump is treating London and Brussels. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because at 11:00 BST we are also expecting an announcement from the EU about what countermeasures it will take if its own efforts to reach a deal fail. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to see that as simply good preparation or a negotiating tactic to get more out of the US but it also points to the difficulty of getting a deal done. Ireland's Enterprise Minister Peter Burke has told the BBC it will be \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery challenging\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the EU to get an agreement sorted before July\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deadline. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s despite the importance of EU-US trade, a relationship worth nearly $1tn (\u00c2\u00a3750bn) last year. Nick EdserBusiness reporter In return for striking a deal on tariffs with the US, the UK is likely to reduce some of the levies it charges on US goods entering the country. The UK currently imposes a 10% tariff on US car imports, but this is expected to be cut. Last month, US business groups were looking at lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5%, and the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, indicated she was open to a cut to secure a wider trade deal. Taxes on US tech firms could also be altered. At the moment the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Digital Services Tax imposes a 2% levy on revenues of tech giants which raises about \u00c2\u00a3800m a year. It affects the likes of US firms such as Amazon and Meta, but there is speculation the tax could be lowered. Tariffs on US farm products could also be cut but, as Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out earlier this year, the UK will not accept US production standards such as chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Chris MasonPolitical editor May is rapidly becoming a month when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be hearing quite a lot about UK trade deals. There was the one with India announced the other day. The week after next there will be a UK-EU Summit in London at which a new deal is expected, and now today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement with America. It is worth remembering that rather a lot can hang under the loose phrase of a trade deal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the arrangements will vary significantly. What we expect in the announcement later is a focus on tariffs or import taxes - in particular, cars. The government will want to talk up whatever it has managed to do to ease the impact of the tariffs imposed by America last month. As ever with deals like this, what are the trade-offs? Many are keeping a keen eye on the digital services tax, which was introduced in the UK five years ago \u00e2\u0080\u009cto ensure\u00e2\u0080\u00a6large multinational businesses\u00e2\u0080\u00a6make a contribution to supporting vital public services\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It generates around \u00c2\u00a3800m a year in revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is it reduced as part of this deal? Expect to see the British government herald the achievement of doing this deal first, before others \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that is unquestionably something of a win. But it will also be worth asking: How much is this an improvement on current trading conditions? And, how much is it an improvement on - six months ago \u00e2\u0080\u0093 before President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs explosion? Prime Minister Keir Starmer briefly references the trade deal with the US during a statement on defence this morning. Starmer talks about working more closely with allies and describes the US as \"indispensable\" for economic and national security. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you know, talks with the US have been ongoing, and you will hear more from me about that later today,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. In his statement, marking 80 years since the end of WW2, Starmer says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll act in the national interest, for workers, businesses and families \u00e2\u0080\u009cto deliver security and renewal for our country\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Earlier, Downing Street confirmed Starmer will make an announcement about a deal with the US on tariffs today. This video can not be played Starmer teases trade deal announcement today Jaguar Land Rover has reportedly resumed exports to the US, after pausing them because of the 25% US tariffs A UK business group has welcomed the trade announcement coming later today. Jordan Cummins, UK competitiveness director at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), tells the BBC's Business Today programme the \"rhetoric\" around tariffs has \"bitten the bottom line\" and \"fed through into output and labour\". \"There are parts of our economy that are really feeling this and they need a big symbolic gesture backed up by some credibility from the government,\" Cummins says. He adds that quick movement, especially on steel and cars \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both of which have been hit with a 25% import tariff by the US \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is \"exactly what we need to see\". Faisal IslamEconomics editor Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been clear that food\nstandards - for example, allowing imports of chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef - will not feature in this deal for domestic political reasons. This is an area where the UK\nhas chosen alignment with EU - and the forthcoming \"Brexit reset\" with the EU - over the US. It would be a diplomatic win for the UK if the US has accepted\neven a narrow deal while dropping demands in this area. Indeed the chancellor\nhinted at this in her interview with me in Washington. The big question here, which I pressed Rachel Reeves about, external, is really\nwhy the US in any way justifies levying a so-called 10% reciprocal tariff\nagainst UK goods. On its own measures, the US sells more to us than it buys from us - ie, there is nothing to \"reciprocate\" against. If a trade deficit is a sign of \"cheating\" as the White House argues, then it is the UK that is suffering. The underlying 10%\ntariff looks like staying in place. This is also an important signal to the\nrest of the world, and to the markets about substantive moves away from a\nglobal trade war. Nick EdserBusiness reporter The pound jumped initially against the US dollar on reports of\na US-UK deal, but the gains were short-lived. Sterling initially climbed 0.5% against the dollar to reach $1.3356\nin Asian trade overnight. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long before it fell back again, and is currently trading just below $1.32 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 close to where it was before news of a\ntrade deal emerged. On the stock market, the FTSE 100 index of the biggest\nUK-listed companies opened little-changed, edging up about five points to 8,564. The financial markets will have a lot to take in today. As\nwell as the trade deal announcement, the Bank of England is expected\nto cut interest rates later, and will also publish its latest forecasts for UK economy. Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, says a US-UK deal \"would be welcome and another Brexit benefit\". However, Griffith says restoring growth to the economy \"also requires reversing Labour's attacks on business\" and reducing \"high energy costs\". \"Conservatives will closely scrutinise any deal which should first be announced to Parliament,\" he says. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper says Parliament \"must be given a vote\" on the deal so it can be \"scrutinised\". \"A good trade deal with the US could bring huge benefits, but Liberal Democrats will oppose any concessions that threaten our NHS, undermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires,\" she says. \"If the government is confident the agreement it has negotiated with Trump is in Britain's national interest, it should not be afraid to bring it before MPs.\" Faisal IslamEconomics editor When I was in the US last month, Chancellor Rachel Reeves hosted the cream of American business and Congress at a packed reception at the embassy, hosted by Ambassador Lord Mandelson. The talk was that the\nUS-UK deal had been done and all it was waiting for was the final nod from\nPresident Trump. It appears that has now happened. But there is a notable\ndifference in how the UK and the US have been describing this arrangement. The chancellor told me about an \"economic and prosperity deal\" but the president\ncalls this a \"major trade deal\". This difference has been there since Keir Starmer met the president in the Oval Office. The narrow scope appears to have\nmeant some consideration of lower tariffs for US\nexports of cars to the UK (from 10% to 2.5%). In return, the UK could win some\nsort of tariff-free or lower tariff quota exemption from the 25% tariffs on\ncars. This is the UK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest goods export. The generosity or not of this\ndepends entirely on the number agreed. Something similar could apply in\nsteel. The big problem was pharmaceuticals. The president has not announced his\ntrade restrictions on medicines yet. The danger was for the UK to agree a deal,\nbut then be hit by a subsequent global tariff on its second most important\ngoods export. Simon JackBusiness editor The UK government has confirmed it will announce an agreement on tariffs later today. Currently the US imposes tariffs of 25% on steel, aluminium and cars - with a baseline or universal tariff of 10% on nearly everything else. The 25% car tariffs have bitten hard as cars are the UK's number one export to the US - worth around \u00c2\u00a39 billion last year. JLR sold 100,000 vehicles in the US last year and temporarily paused exports last month. What car industry executives are keen to learn is whether there will be an across-the-board lowering of tariffs, or whether a quota system will be imposed under which tariffs are low or zero, with additional charges on vehicles above that quota. Industry executives have told the BBC they much prefer the former - as a quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively. But as one executive said - a quota system would be \"better than nothing\". In return, the UK may abolish or reduce the 2% digital sales tax imposed on large US ecommerce sellers like Amazon. This was expected to raise \u00c2\u00a3800 million a year and was imposed to help level the playing field for high street and smaller retailers - so a non-trivial concession if given. Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent The UK has been desperate for a deal of this sort with the US since President Trump unleashed his wave of global tariffs. So have other countries. It seems the UK has got there first - a significant achievement by Keir Starmer and his government. In fact, those close to the talks have been saying for some time that the shape of a deal was basically there, but that it was never quite clear when and whether the maverick president might sign off on what his negotiating team had thrashed out. That he has done so this week makes this a highly significant few days for UK trade, coming just two days after the full free trade agreement between the UK and India. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clear political boost for the prime minister here too: finalising the deal with India his Conservative predecessors could not reach, and coming to some sort of agreement with the US - even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short of the comprehensive free trade agreement the Conservative governments talked about reaching and never managed. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a broader point too. Starmer has made a point of forging a warm relationship with Trump  - warmer than many expected. There had been growing grumblings about what dividend he was receiving for his efforts, on trade, Ukraine and any number of other issues. Here is his answer. Downing Street has confirmed that Keir Starmer will make an announcement about a deal with the US on tariffs later today. A spokesperson for No 10 says the US is an \"indispensable ally for both our economic and national security\" and \"talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace\". \"The prime minister will update later today,\" they add. Dharshini DavidDeputy economics editor The US remains the UK's biggest single trading partner (in\nterms of individual countries) - buying almost \u00c2\u00a3200bn of British exports.  The UK's biggest goods exports by value last year were\ncars and pharmaceuticals - hence why any tariff exemptions for those areas are important.  But\nthere are many more categories - from food to scientific equipment - which in\ntotal account for the majority of goods exports.  However,\ntwo-thirds of what the UK sells to the US is services - from advertising to banking\n- which are unaffected by tariffs. Yet that growing importance makes maintaining close\nties key.  Overall the UK sells as much, broadly, to the US sells to the UK.  That trade balance - a far cry from the deficit of several hundred billions of dollars the US runs\nwith China - is one reason why President Trump is amenable to talks\nwith the UK. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expected announcement comes just days after the UK and India announced a trade deal. That deal will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and will cut taxes on India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing and footwear exports. Some Indian and British workers will also gain from a three-year exemption from social security payments, which the Indian government called \"an unprecedented achievement\". The exemption applies to the staff of Indian companies temporarily transferred to the UK, and to UK firms' workers transferred to India. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and \"deliver for British people and business\". India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was \"ambitious and mutually beneficial\".",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15ng4g5g0eo",
      "content": "The US and the UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs later. It's thought US President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports will stay, but that the UK will see cuts to the 25% tariffs on some of its biggest exports. Here's a look at what could be in the deal. US President Donald Trump declared on social media the announcement to come later would be a \"major trade deal\" - it won't be. He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress. Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on Trump's tariffs. What it will be is some exemptions or lowering of those tariffs on specific goods. What is announced today is likely to be only the bare bones of a narrow agreement. There will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow. It could also be relatively short-term, covering just a few items. Currently, most goods imported from the UK to the US face a blanket 10% tariff and that's expected to remain. But this deal is likely to reduce tariffs on specific items set to be subject to higher tariffs. Trump has already placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US. Cars are our biggest export to the US - worth about \u00a39bn last year. What we could get later is a lowering of this 25% tariff, or a quota system. A quota system would allow the UK to sell a certain number of cars into the US under low or zero tariffs, with extra charges on vehicles above that quota. Car industry leaders have told the BBC they would much prefer lower tariffs across the board - as a quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively. The UK currently imposes a 10% on US car imports, but is expected to lower this. The US has demanded the import tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated she is open to such a cut. A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US came into effect in March. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK would \"keep all options on the table\", but did not announce immediate retaliation. The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, around \u00a3700m in total. However the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, including things such as gym equipment, furniture and machinery. These are worth much more, about \u00a32.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year. Steel industry leaders have warned if the 25% tariff isn't lowered or removed it will be devastating for the industry. It's not known whether the agreement between the US and the UK will lead to a cut in the rate or the introduction of quotas. Tariffs could lead to US companies buying less from overseas. A knock-on effect could be more cheap steel flooding other markets, including the UK, as trade is redirected, putting more pressure on an already struggling industry. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is unknown. Most countries, including the US, imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, as part of an agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable. Pharmaceuticals are a major export for the UK when it comes to US trade \u2013 last year sales of medicinal and pharmaceutical products were worth \u00a36.6bn ($8.76bn) making it the UK's second-biggest export to the US. It's also America's fourth biggest export to the UK, valued at \u00a34bn ($5.3bn) last year. The president has not announced any trade restrictions on medicines yet. There is a danger that the UK could agree a deal, but is then subsequently hit by a global tariff. There is speculation the UK could lower its 2% digital services tax on US firms in return for lower tariffs on things like car and pharmaceutical exports. The tax is on businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces and applies to revenues derived from UK users. Firms only have to pay it if they raise more than \u00a3500m in global revenues and \u00a325m from UK users annually. But this is a threshold easily met by US tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple. The UK reportedly netted nearly \u00a3360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year. In weighing up whether to cut this tax, the UK will have had to balance its drive to raise revenue and further growth with the political risk of being seen to concede to big tech, or President Trump. Tariffs on US farm products could also be cut. However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been clear that food standards - for example, allowing imports of chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef - will not feature in this deal for domestic political reasons. This is an area where the UK has chosen alignment with EU - and the forthcoming \"Brexit reset\" with the EU - over the US. Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s. The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones. It would be seen as a diplomatic win for the UK if the US has accepted even a narrow deal while dropping demands in this area.",

      "content": "Foxconn, the maker of Apple's iPhones, has announced plans to produce electric vehicles (EV) for Japanese car giant Mitsubishi Motors. Under the agreement in principle, a Foxconn joint venture will design and build cars in Taiwan for Mitsubishi. The companies say they expect the new model to be available by the end of next year, under what would be Foxconn's first major contract in the booming and highly competitive EV industry. Japanese car makers like Mitsubishi have faced growing competition from mainland Chinese rivals, particularly in markets in South East Asia, South America and Europe. The companies said the cars will be built by Foxtron - Foxconn's EV joint venture with Taiwanese car maker, Yulon Motor. \"Foxtron will provide design and manufacturing management services and this model is expected to enter the Australia and New Zealand markets in the second half of 2026,\" they added. At this stage, the agreement is a so-called memorandum of understanding - a non-binding deal between the two companies. The companies have said they \"will proceed with discussions towards a definitive agreement.\" Foxconn is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and counts major technology companies such has Apple among its customers. It previously said it would consider buying a stake in Japan's Nissan Motor for \"co-operation\" as it looked to get into the motor industry. Mitsubishi Motors is a junior partner in an alliance between Nissan and French car maker Renault. The moves come as China's car industry has expanded rapidly in recent years and the world's second largest economy has emerged as a leader in the growing EV market. Established car makers around the world have struggled to compete as major Chinese players like BYD continue to win new customers.",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglxldgx0l5o",
      "content": "The US central bank has warned that President Donald Trump's tariffs have created \"so much uncertainty\" that it is unsure what to do about interest rates. The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it would keep interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs. But Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economic fallout from Trump's tariffs meant it was \"not at all clear\" what the bank should do next. The decision marked the third in a row without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate hovering around 4.3%. Powell said if Trump's tariff policies remain in place they were likely \"to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment\". Typically, the Fed cuts rates if it believes the economy is struggling and raises them if prices start to rise too quickly. But the bank - which is set up to make policy independent of the White House -said tariffs had raised the risk of both an economic slowdown and faster price rises, complicating its next move. \"It's really not at all clear what it is we should do,\" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. \"There's so much uncertainty.\" Wednesday's decision is the Fed's first since Trump's tariff announcements last month raised import taxes on goods from countries around the world, with imports from China facing duties of at least 145%. Logistics firms and ports in the US have since reported sharp drops in trade, while analysts have warned that the risk of recession has ramped up significantly since the start of the year. Trump, who promised lower rates while campaigning for re-election last year, has called on the Fed to lower rates \"pre-emptively\" and flirted with firing the head of the bank, criticising him as \"a major loser\" and \"Mr Too Late\" for not cutting rates fast enough. The European Central Bank cut interest rates last month, citing concerns about the economy due to the trade tensions. The Bank of England is widely expected to take a similar step this week. Officials from the US and China are set to meet this week, but the scope of the talks remains unclear. Trump on Wednesday dismissed the idea of lowering tariff rates pre-emptively to help trade negotiations. Powell said the talks had the potential to change the economic picture \"materially\". \"Usually, things clarify and the appropriate direction becomes clear,\" he said. \"Right now it's very hard to say what that would be. In the meantime, the economy is doing fine.\" The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year for the first time since 2022. But officials said those figures had been distorted by firms rushing goods into the country ahead of tariffs rather than a decline in wider activity. Hiring remained unexpectedly strong last month, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows of 4.2% while the US stock market has largely recovered from the sharp declines it saw last month. Powell said those figures gave the Fed time to wait. \"We can move quickly when that's appropriate but we think right now the appropriate thing to do is wait and see how things evolve,\" he said.",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r8rg4w2v0o",
      "content": "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games. That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store. Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\" The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\" \"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote. Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games. In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases. The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules. She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem. Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead. In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.  On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store. The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful. \"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote. Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives. In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to. \"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote. The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote. Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals. Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. Outside the UK?

      "content": "RBZ Hands Out US$10 Million to 135 Companies Through Targeted Finance Facility The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has pumped ZiG300 million (around US$10 million) into the economy through a special funding facility aimed at boosting key industries. Since January, 135 private sector companies have benefited from the initiative, which offers affordable loans to support economic growth. According to RBZ data, the agriculture sector was the biggest winner, with 60 companies accessing funds from the Targeted Finance Facility (TFF). The manufacturing sector wasn\u2019t far behind, with 53 companies benefiting. Meanwhile, 18 firms in the wholesale and retail space also got a slice of the funding, and the construction and energy sectors saw four companies each receive support. RBZ Governor Dr John Mushayavanhu explained that agriculture and manufacturing were prioritised because of their crucial role in driving Zimbabwe\u2019s economic growth. \u201cIn line with the facility objectives, the manufacturing and agriculture sectors received the biggest share of the funding, given their significant contribution to domestic production. An analysis of historical growth trends of the Zimbabwe economy shows that strong recovery in agriculture and manufacturing production has had significant positive impacts on the economy,\u201d Dr Mushayavanhu said. Also read:\u00a0\u2018We no longer need the black market\u2019: Why Zimbabwean Manufacturers Are Now Turning Away From Parallel Forex Dealers The TFF, launched by the RBZ at the start of 2025, is designed to boost the economy without causing inflation. It does this by offering low-interest loans to productive industries, while keeping the country\u2019s tight monetary policy intact. Under the TFF, banks borrow money from the central bank at 20% interest and are allowed to on-lend to businesses at a maximum rate of 30%. Loans are short-term, with a maximum repayment period of 270 days. Borrowers can take out and repay loans in ZiG or foreign currency at the current exchange rate. Dr Mushayavanhu expressed satisfaction with how the facility is working. \u201cOverall, the TFF has enabled the Reserve Bank to make available targeted liquidity to the productive sectors of the economy, while maintaining its current tight monetary policy stance, aimed at durably reducing inflation to low and sustainable levels,\u201d he added. Speaking virtually at the ZITF 2025 International Business Conference last week, Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube assured businesses that government will continue to tighten the screws to make sure the TFF stays effective and truly benefits the economy.

Writing on the social media platform X, Charamba explained that some Black farmers were used by white farmers to try and protect their land from government takeover. \u201cAt the height of Fast Track Land Reforms, a number of black Zimbabweans became parapets behind whom hid several white farmers who sought to deflect and defeat the programme,\u201d wrote Charamba under his X handle @Jamwanda2. \u201cIn short, white farmers would \u2018transfer\u2019 their farms to those blacks in the hope of saving the farms from acquisition.\u201d Charamba\u2019s post came in response to prominent lawyer and businessman Tawanda Nyambirai\u2019s claim that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had personally intervened to restore land to him and other Black Zimbabweans who lost their farms under the first republic. Tawanda Nyambirai revealed that he lost his land because of political abuse of the system by powerful figures. \u201cIn my case, it was the late General Mujuru who abused the system and targeted me,\u201d Nyambirai wrote. \u201cHis main target was Mr Strive Masiyiwa as was later explained to me by the former First Family\u2026 When HE discovered that the situation was too dangerous for me after my brothers were kidnapped, he advised me to vacate the farms and wait for sanity to prevail before vindicating my rights.\u201d Nyambirai said he was eventually helped by the late Vice President Msika and Chester Mhende. He added that President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was the speaker of Parliament then,\u00a0 was supportive and had even advised him to step aside temporarily to avoid violence. Nyambirai confirmed that he followed all the legal steps to reclaim his farms. He said the land was restored after 20 years, thanks to direct intervention from President Mnangagwa. \u201cUpon being reminded that I lost my farms under the First Republic, the President directed that my farms be restored,\u201d he said. \u201cI followed the prescribed legal process and indeed the title to my farms was restored after 20 years. We are now in the final stages of taking back possession.\u201d Nyambirai also mentioned that the group he belongs to includes other Black farmers who held land through companies. Charamba responded by thanking Nyambirai for clarifying the history. \u201cThank you for clarifying matters for the sake of truth and history. Kune vanga voshandisa your case to badmouth Land Reforms. Anyway, justice was restored and we are happy for you and your family,\u201d Charamba posted. He added that not all land losses were the same. \u201cI would never put landless blacks as a population in the same group with Rhodesian landed gentry, thereby creating a false impression their SCARS were comparable,\u201d Charamba said. He concluded by noting that Zimbabwe\u2019s land issue continues to draw global interest. \u201cIt\u2019s not fortuitous that the Zim land issue is being revisited now when Trump has pronounced himself on SA\u2019s racist land policies,\u201d he said.

      "content": "The government of Zimbabwe is now restoring farms to black farmers who lost their land during the controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme under former President Robert Mugabe, businessman and lawyer Tawanda Nyambirai has revealed. Writing on social media platform X, Nyambirai said the directive to return the farms to black indigenous farmers came from President Emmerson Mnangagwa himself. \u201cUpon being reminded that I lost my farms under the First Republic, the President directed that my farms be restored. I followed the prescribed legal process and indeed the title to my farms was restored after 20 years,\u201d wrote Nyambirai on 24 April 2025. \u201cWe are now in the final stages of taking back possession. My Senior Brother, Nic Vingirai was also assisted. We have an association of black indigenous farmers who lost land. We are all grateful that the Government, especially the President himself, has stepped forward to give us redress.\u201d Nyambirai revealed that an organised group of black indigenous farmers who had lost their land had formed an association to engage the government and navigate the legal process. When asked if the group included companies that lost land during the programme, he replied: \u201cSome members of the group held their farms through their companies.\u201d He stressed the importance of acknowledging progress, saying: \u201cWe must always give credit where it is due.\u201d Presidential spokesperson George Charamba responded positively to the news, thanking Nyambirai for shedding light on the issue. \u201cThank you for clarifying matters for the sake of truth and history. Kune vanga voshandisa your case to badmouth Land Reforms. Anyway, justice was restored and we are happy for you and your family.\u201d Nyambirai went on to give more personal context about how he lost his land. He said the late General Solomon Mujuru had targeted him, and that the real target was telecommunications magnate Strive Masiyiwa. \u201cIn my case, it was the late General Mujuru who abused the system and targeted me. His main target was Mr Strive Masiyiwa, as was later explained to me by the former First Family,\u201d he revealed. Nyambirai explained that President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was the speaker of Parliament at the time,\u00a0 had tried to help but ultimately advised him to leave his farm for safety after his brothers were kidnapped. \u201cHE [President Emmerson Mnangagwa] did his best to assist me after he was requested to help me by the late VP Msika and by a dear friend, Mr Chester Mhende. \u201cWhen HE discovered that the situation was too dangerous for me after my brothers were kidnapped, he advised me to vacate the farms and wait for sanity to prevail before vindicating my rights. \u201cHE was for land reform, but not for the violence. HE always believed that some cases deserved compensation and that land must have title.\u201d He also mentioned that Mnangagwa had played a behind-the-scenes role in trying to assist. \u201cI was privileged to know the side of HE that is hidden to many. If I was better at making friends, I would have had the privilege of being closer to him.\u201d The restoration comes nearly 20 years after the farms were seized. \u201cJustice was restored,\u201d Charamba concluded in his reply.

      "content": "It would mark the first deal agreed upon since Mr Trump\u2019s \u2018liberation day\u2019 announcement of global tariffs last month I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The UK and US are expected to agree a deal to reduce tariffs on Thursday after Donald Trump promised a \u201cmajor trade deal\u201d with a \u201chighly respected country\u201d. A month after the US president\u2019s so-called liberation day tariffs came into effect, British negotiators are in Washington and are believed to have finalised a carve-out for the UK. In a coup for Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Trump is expected to unveil the agreement at an Oval Office press conference on Thursday. Speaking on Thursday, Sir Keir said: \u201cAs you know talks with the us have been ongoing and you will hear more from me about that later \u201cBut make no mistake, I will always act in our national interest for workers, businesses and families to deliver security and renewal for our country. \u201cBecause the world has changed, decisively.\u201d Mr Trump took to his Truth Social platform to announce he would hold a news conference at 10am local time (3pm BST) about a \u201cmajor trade deal with representatives of a big, and highly respected, country\u201d. The government has been pursuing a deal with the US to reduce the impact of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr Trump last month, which placed a 10 per cent levy on all UK exports and a 25 per cent charge on steel, aluminium and cars. Reports have previously suggested a deal could see the UK reduce some tariffs on US products, as well as change the digital services tax that currently affects mainly US tech companies. But the government has ruled out lowering food standards to allow more US agricultural products into the country, or watering down the Online Safety Act, which some in the US regard as placing restrictions on freedom of speech. It would mark the first deal agreed upon since Mr Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs last month wreaked havoc on global markets and put the UK\u2019s public finances in jeopardy. The deal would be a vindication of Sir Keir\u2019s approach to the US president, having been reluctant to criticise Mr Trump and senior members of his administration. As Labour reels from a bruising set of local election results, it is also a fresh boost for the prime minister, coming hot on the heels of a major agreement struck with India on Tuesday. The US and UK have been holding talks over a potential trade deal, with chancellor Rachel Reeves saying the government has been working \u201cflat out\u201d to secure an agreement that would mitigate the impact of the tariffs. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College London, told The Independent the trade deal would be \u201cdamage limitation rather than an economic boost\u201d. \u201cThat is, it is likely to limit the Trump tariffs, but our exporters will probably still be facing higher tariffs overall than they were last year,\u201d he said. Professor Portes added: \u201cThis will clearly be a relief to companies and the government deserves credit, but Trump\u2019s policies overall remain a huge downside to the global economy and hence to the UK.\u201d The defence secretary declined to comment on reports that a US-UK trade deal would be announced on Thursday. John Healey told Times Radio: \"It's certainly true that the US is an indispensable ally for the UK, both on economic and national security grounds. \"It's also true that since the prime minister visited the White House in February we have been in detailed talks about an economic deal. \"But I have to say, throughout that period, ministers like me have been keen to give the negotiations the space to get the best possible deal for the UK. \"So, we just haven't been giving a running commentary on developments or timelines, so I'm not going to start now.\" The Liberal Democrats called for parliament to be given a vote on any US trade agreement, with a warning it could \u201cundermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires\u201d. Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Daisy Cooper said: \u201cA good trade deal with the US could bring huge benefits, but Liberal Democrats are deeply concerned that it may include measures that threaten our NHS, undermine our farmers or give tax cuts to US tech billionaires. \u201cIf the government is confident the agreement it has negotiated with Trump is in Britain\u2019s national interest, it should not be afraid to bring it before MPs.\u201d The UK announced it had come to terms on a trade deal with India on Tuesday, which will mean dramatic tariff reductions on scotch whisky and car exports to the country. Levies on aerospace, electricals and other food products will also fall under the agreement, while UK consumers are expected to benefit from tariffs being reduced on some Indian goods such as clothing imported to the country. Announcing the deal, prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \u201cWe are now in a new era for trade and the economy. That means going further and faster to strengthen the UK\u2019s economy, putting more money in working people\u2019s pockets.\u201d He added: \u201cToday we have agreed a landmark deal with India \u2013 one of the fastest growing economies in the world, which will grow the economy and deliver for British people and business.\u201d Indian prime minister Narendra Modi described it as a \u201chistoric milestone\u201d and an \u201cambitious and mutually beneficial\u201d trade agreement that will \u201ccatalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies\u201d.

      "content": "I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Digitising NHS and social care will cost \u00a321 billion over the next five years, but could be vital for driving down waiting lists, according to new research. A report said the UK will need to spend billions to fully implement electronic patient records, cloud storage, cyber security and wi-fi, with the skills and capabilities needed to use them. The Health Foundation charity commissioned PA Consulting ahead of the forthcoming Government spending review, and publication of the 10-year health plan, to estimate the costs of making the transformation to digital services. The Government has pledged to move the health service from analogue to digital as part of its \u201cthree shifts\u201d for the NHS, which also include moving care from hospitals to communities and preventing sickness. In the new report, estimates suggest that \u00a38 billion of capital spending (of which \u00a35 billion is for England) is needed for things like hardware, software and electronic patient records. A further \u00a33 billion would be one-off revenue spending (of which \u00a32.25 billion is for England), for planning, initial education and training, implementation of new technologies and transition from old systems. Some \u00a32 billion recurring annual spending (of which \u00a31.5 billion per year is for England) over five years is also needed for ongoing training, software subscriptions, maintenance, improvement and optimisation. Recurring costs will then carry on beyond the five-year period. According to the Health Foundation, while it may be possible to cover some of the costs from existing budgets, it is highly likely the Government will need to commit additional funding. Tom Hardie, senior improvement fellow at the Health Foundation, said: \u201cDigitisation is going to be really critical for the NHS and social care to be sustainable and fit for the 21st century. \u201cWhen we talk about waiting times in particular, I think there are hopes that digitisation could help to address waiting times. \u201cWithin this research, we haven\u2019t set out to define or quantify the benefits of digitisation, but I think it\u2019s possible to say that digitisation could theoretically help to reduce waiting times. \u201cSo, for example, making it easier and simpler for people to get appointments or to cancel and rebook appointments. \u201cIt could help to optimise (operating) theatre schedules, improve prevention of acute episodes of care through remote monitoring of people with health conditions, improved triage processes to help direct people to the right services first time (and) perhaps avoiding more resource-intensive services like A&E.\u201d Making the NHS more digitally capable will also free up staff time, he said. Figures suggest that medics lose more than 13.5 million hours a year because of inadequate or malfunctioning IT. Dr Malte Gerhold, director of innovation and improvement at the Health Foundation, said:\u00a0\u201cOur independently commissioned research finds that to achieve the Government\u2019s ambitions to digitise health and social care, significant spending will be needed over the next five years and beyond. \u201cBut direct investment in technology alone is not sufficient. \u201cThe Government must fund the change not just the tech. This means investing in and planning for implementation and change to genuinely realise the benefits of digitisation for patients and staff.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the private sector is 15 years ahead of the NHS on technology, adding: \u201cThis Government is bringing our analogue NHS into the digital age, to improve the productivity of the NHS, deliver better care for patients and better value for taxpayers. \u201cWe are already making significant progress by introducing cutting-edge AI and technology to support clinicians and improve care, reforming the NHS app to give patients more control, and centralising patient records to speed up diagnosis and treatment. \u201cThis is only possible because of the increase in employers\u2019 national insurance, which allowed us to invest an extra \u00a326 billion for health and social care.\u201d",

      "content": "The Independent explains what is likely to form a US trade deal ahead of its announcement on Thursday I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Donald Trump is poised to unveil a \u201cmajor trade deal\u201d with the UK on Thursday, the culmination of Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s months-long charm offensive towards the US president. A month after his so-called Liberation Day tariffs began to bite, Britain is desperate for a carve out from the 25 per cent levies on its steel and car industries. The deal will be a major boost for the prime minister, coming hot on the heels of a trade agreement between the UK and India this week. But any deal with the US will come with trade-offs, with a key focus for the Americans being access to Britain for tech companies whose bosses are allies of the administration. Here The Independent looks at what is likely to be in a trade deal ahead of its announcement on Thursday. The UK is hoping for an exemption from Mr Trump\u2019s 25 per cent levies on steel, aluminium and cars. Exporters have been lobbying ministers hard over the impact of the tariffs, which forced Jaguar Land Rover to suspend exports to the US last month. Britain\u2019s beleaguered steel industry has also warned the US president\u2019s tariffs pose further challenges for the sector. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t come at a worse time,\u201d Gareth Stace, director general of the UK Steel trade association said when they came into force. Around 5 per cent of UK steel exports and 6 per cent of aluminium exports go to the US, according to the government. While Britain hopes for an exemption from the higher 25 per cent tariffs, the trade deal is unlikely to see Mr Trump\u2019s baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports lifted for the UK. One of the biggest goals of US negotiators has been to win concessions on Britain\u2019s digital services tax (DST), paid by overseas search engines and social media sites on revenues from the UK. It would be a boost to major American firms such as Amazon, Facebook owner Meta and Google owner Alphabet. One mooted change would be to lower the headline rate paid by the US tech giants, while at the same time applying it to companies from other countries to make up the shortfall. It would mean no tax income would be lost from the levy overall, with the DST currently raising \u00a3800m a year. The government has also reportedly offered to lower tariffs on American chicken, beef and other meats, in a move which could further inflame tensions between Labour and farmers. A consistent red line in negotiations has been food standards, amid fears a trade deal could open Britain\u2019s doors to hormone-injected beef and chlorinated chicken. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and the chancellor have both ruled out lowering Britain's food standards to get a deal over the line, in a boost to struggling farmers. Industries who will be watching Mr Trump\u2019s Oval Office announcement closely on Thursday include the film and TV industry and pharmaceutical industry. Mr Trump has threatened to levy 100 per cent tariffs on films made outside America, which the PM has been warned would devastate film and TV production in the UK. British officials have been locked in talks with US counterparts since Mr Trump outlined the plans, with a view to exempting Britain from the levies. Officials have also been desperately trying to exempt British firms from a fresh threatened 25 per cent tariff on pharmaceuticals produced abroad. The measure would have a huge impact on UK giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, and negotiators are racing to find a carve out. The key point to remember is that Thursday\u2019s trade deal is not the long sought after post-Brexit trade deal with the US, chased by successive prime ministers. The deal is likely to have a narrower focus than the wide-ranging agreement struck with India on Tuesday. Talks are likely to continue about a more ambitious agreement in the long run, but Thursday\u2019s deal is expected to ease the immediate pressure of Mr Trump\u2019s trade war.

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/politics/fired-federal-workers-trump-jobs",
      "content": "After firing tens of thousands of federal workers this year, President Donald Trump has also made it much harder for them to get their jobs back as he imposes his will over the labor agencies that are supposed to protect their rights. He has hobbled independent labor boards, installed a loyalist at a key agency that protects civil servants, and signed an executive order to end collective bargaining for many federal workers. This has left government employees with dwindling options to contest their firings through channels normally available to civil servants, with many turning to the courts for relief or giving up altogether. \u201cIt is significantly more difficult for a federal employee to have their case heard by an independent body,\u201d said former Merit Systems Protection Board member Ray Limon. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is a complete elimination of traditional employee due process and investigation of complaints, which is unparalleled in the history of our government.\u201d Related article\nAnalyzing the scale of Trump\u2019s federal layoffs in his first 100 days In an effort to ensure a stable, professional and merit-based workforce across administrations, Congress has long mandated certain due-process protections from arbitrary firings for the more than 2 million federal employees. But as federal employees \u2013 ranging from newer \u201cprobationary\u201d workers who were fired en masse, to career civil servants who believe they were dismissed  for partisan purposes \u2013 seek to challenge their terminations in the second Trump administration, they are finding it harder than ever to push back. Amid sweeping layoffs and resignations, civic groups have stepped in to connect some of these disillusioned workers with new jobs in state and local government. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is fighting in court to defend his mass firings and executive orders. \u201cPresident Trump is the chief executive of the executive branch and reserves the right to fire anyone he wants,\u201d White House press secretary  Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. The reversal of fortunes for fired employees has been most glaring at the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which was created by Congress in the post-Watergate era to safeguard merit systems in the federal government. The agency often advocates on behalf of employees at the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which reviews workers\u2019 complaints. Hampton Dellinger was one year into his five-year term at OSC when Trump was sworn in. It didn\u2019t take long for the Senate-confirmed Biden appointee to break ranks with Trump on a major priority for the new administration: shrinking the size of the federal workforce. Dellinger concluded that Trump\u2019s mass firings of probationary workers were unlawful, and successfully urged the MSPB to reinstate 6,000 employees. Advocacy groups hailed the outcome as a landmark moment that could pave the way for additional reinstatements. Then, Trump fired Dellinger. After Dellinger lost a brief court battle over his own termination, Trump turned to two loyalists to fill his role. He tapped Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins in February to temporarily lead OSC, and by late March, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer was slotted into the acting role. Under Greer\u2019s watch, OSC dropped its support for reinstating any probationary employees. OSC notified some federal employees in late April that it conducted a \u201creview\u201d and determined that the firings were proper and were \u201cin accordance with the new administration\u2019s priorities,\u201d according to legal filings and records reviewed by CNN. This was a 180-degree turn from OSC\u2019s position under Dellinger. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing OSC not actually do the kinds of things it\u2019s supposed to be doing,\u201d said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which represented the 6,000 reinstated workers. \u201cThe administration\u2026 is seeking to undermine accountability structures that were put in place to ensure federal employees have redress and civil service protections.\u201d An OSC spokesman declined to comment. The Trump administration has also defanged, at least for the time being, two federal labor boards \u2013 which serve as bulwarks against partisan abuses and workplace discrimination by independently reviewing complaints. MSPB and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) are currently without a quorum after Trump fired several members, leaving them operational but unable to function at full strength.  The people Trump fired were appointed by President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate. For instance, the MSPB can\u2019t issue final rulings on workers\u2019 complaints without a quorum. And the EEOC isn\u2019t able to initiate major litigation or vote on policy rulemaking. One MSPB member that Trump fired has filed a lawsuit to get her job back, which would restore a quorum. But she faces an uphill fight at the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, which has already rebuffed her bid to get back on the job while her legal case plays out. MSPB spokesman Zachary Kurz said the agency \u201cremains open for business and its work continues,\u201d adding that its \u201cability to adjudicate cases is fully functional across its regional offices, and it will continue to process petitions for review.\u201d EEOC spokesman James Ryan said the commission \u201cis still open for business and taking all charges.\u201d In December, during the presidential transition, the EEOC voted on a bipartisan basis to delegate some of its powers to commission staff, which they could use if a quorum is lost. There are signs that the Trump administration may be slow-walking some MSPB cases. Typically, the agency facing a worker\u2019s complaint will defend itself at MSPB. But the lead HR agency overseeing federal civil servants, the Office of Personnel Management, is intervening in more than 40 pending cases involving Justice Department officials that were fired in March, according to filings reviewed by CNN. OPM has asked an administrative judge to pause all of the 40-plus cases, according to the filings. CNN has reached out to OPM for comment about its intervention in these MSPB cases. Limon, the former Democratic-appointed MSPB member, said it is \u201cvery unusual\u201d for OPM to intervene in pending cases like these. It never happened during his three years as vice chairman, he said, but it could be warranted if there is an apparent conflict of interest. One of the cases was filed by Liz Oyer, the former Justice Department pardon attorney who was part of a large group of firings approved by Todd Blanche, the former Trump lawyer who is now deputy attorney general. Oyer claims she was terminated because she refused to bow to pressure from Trump appointees who wanted her to restore the gun rights of actor Mel Gibson, which he lost after a 2011 state domestic violence conviction. \u201cIt does not seem like the MSPB proceeding will be resolved anytime soon,\u201d Oyer told CNN. \u201cThe Justice Department is doing everything they can to delay and avoid providing any information about the reasons for my firing and others. This is frustrating and unfortunate for everyone who lost their jobs and who have no other recourse.\u201d Blanche previously told CNN in a statement that Oyer\u2019s \u201cversion of events is false\u201d and \u201cerroneous.\u201d CNN has reported that some fired workers are struggling to navigate overlapping agencies that handle complaints and to decipher the \u201clegalese\u201d on government websites. Union stewards often help members through this process but those efforts have been undermined by Trump\u2019s recent executive order attempting to end collective bargaining rights for a large share of the federal workforce. Alex Berman, an Internal Revenue Service employee who is a union leader in Philadelphia, said some of his colleagues aren\u2019t sure if they are even allowed to talk to their union representatives after Trump\u2019s executive order. And in some IRS offices, he said union leaders have been banned from using official time to answer questions from union members, as was permitted under their existing contract when Trump took office. The IRS didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u2018Most employees know what they\u2019re supposed to do for their jobs, but don\u2019t know what recourse there may be in any given situation, up to and including a firing,\u201d Berman said. \u201cWithout the unions, people are in the dark as to what their rights and responsibilities are.\u201d His group, the National Treasury Employees Union, has repeatedly sued the Trump administration and convinced a judge to block his collective-bargaining ban. It\u2019s one of more than a dozen labor unions, anti-Trump groups, and advocacy organizations that launched a legal defense fund to help people \u201cwho have been fired illegally\u201d under Trump. Some terminated employees \u2013 like the probationary hires, and the former top OSC and MSPB officials \u2013 saw initial success in court, where judges ruled that their firings were unlawful. But the Trump administration has prevailed in reversing some of those decisions, some on a temporary basis, as they are heard by more conservative federal appellate courts. \u201cThe courts will be increasingly important as the administration seeks to close other avenues for redress,\u201d said Perryman, whose group is involved in the legal defense fund. She said more than 1,000 lawyers signed up in the first week to volunteer their time. As morale falls with each round of mass firings, some groups see an opportunity. Caitlin Lewis, the executive director at Work For America, launched a service that is trying to match up thousands of federal employees with jobs in state or local government. \u201cOversight authorities and regulatory authorities are being stripped of their powers,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe overwhelming sentiment is exhaustion and frustration. They don\u2019t feel equipped to take on the system as individuals. As they\u2019ve been left in this state of purgatory and confusion, their faith is diminishing that the system is going to protect their legal rights.\u201d Her CivicMatch platform has seen a 15-fold increase in activity since Trump took office, with more than 8,000 federal workers expressing interest in new public sector jobs. Many worked at hard-hit agencies like the IRS and the US Agency for International Development. While some workers are mobile, plenty of others are unable to uproot their families in search of new opportunities, especially in an uncertain economic climate. For those who are willing to make the move, however, some states and cities recently stepped up recruitment efforts, to fill their own ranks with veterans of the public service sector \u2013 and to stand up to Trump. \u201cMore and more people are unwilling to wait it out,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment of loss for the federal government, but it\u2019s a moment of possibility for state and local governments.\u201d",

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/08/politics/cia-director-ratcliffe-spotlight-reorganization",
      "content": "As one of the last federal agencies to face major changes in President Donald Trump\u2019s norm-bending second term, the CIA is bracing for significant cuts and a reorganization that seeks to elevate covert operations by hiring more officers to go in the field and fewer analysts to sit behind computer screens. The coming changes have sharpened the focus on CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who so far has walked a fine line between maintaining favor with the White House and building trust with career rank-and-file officers at the storied spy agency that Trump views as a key part of the so-called \u201cDeep State.\u201d Up to now, Ratcliffe appears to have insulated the CIA from the kind of political meddling by the White House that many career officials have feared would come with a second Trump administration. Ratcliffe and his deputy Michael Ellis \u201cmay have come to the conclusion that these people are professionals, there really is no deep state out here,\u201d said one former senior intelligence official. \u201cBut now you are pushing against the White House that believes there is.\u201d Several intelligence officials said Ratcliffe seems to spend most of his time across the river at the White House \u2013 leaving some in the workforce with the impression he is very \u201chands-off,\u201d one US official said. Others said it\u2019s not clear to the rank-and-file who is really running the agency, with another former official describing the CIA as \u201crudderless\u201d \u2013 deepening concerns among some career professionals that the uncertainty will lead to a brain drain as talented officers retire or take Trump\u2019s buyout offer. Overall, the sentiment toward Ratcliffe among career officials within CIA headquarters at Langley is lukewarm, multiple current and former US officials told CNN, with one official describing him as \u201cthe least bad option\u201d to serve as Trump\u2019s CIA director. \u201cBeing at the White House all the time is a good thing,\u201d a person close to Trump told CNN. \u201cIt would be far more concerning if Ratcliffe was never meeting with the president. It shows he still values him.\u201d So far, Ratcliffe has not made the kind of broad cuts that the administration has demanded of other agencies, despite a clear desire by Trump and his allies to reshape the spy agency. Ratcliffe\u2019s relationship with the White House has allowed him the latitude to manage the agency on his own timeline, sources close to the president say. Some career officials see Ratcliffe as quietly acting as a kind of buffer between the White House and the agency. \u201cAs he has learned more about our people and capabilities I think he is wanting to support us, but most of his time is spent downtown and Cabinet focused,\u201d said another US official, adding that \u201crunning the organization is really falling more on\u201d Ratcliffe\u2019s deputy, Ellis. \u201cDirector Ratcliffe has made it clear that CIA will pursue President Trump\u2019s national security priorities with laser-like focus,\u201d CIA spokesperson Liz Lyons said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe Agency is determined to provide the President with an unparalleled advantage and, under Director Ratcliffe, it is aggressively doing just that. Any insinuation to the contrary is false and completely baseless.\u201d Ratcliffe, a former Republican Texas congressman, has taken a deliberately under-the-radar approach during his first few months on the job, meeting with Trump behind closed doors at the White House and making selective media appearances. He has also played a key role in helping the administration navigate some of its most pressing foreign policy challenges. In April, Trump sent Ratcliffe to Israel for high-level discussions about the administration\u2019s ongoing pursuit of a deal with Iran to surrender its entire nuclear program, according to two sources familiar with the trip. Earlier in Trump\u2019s second term, Ratcliffe also quietly helped to secure the release of multiple Americans held in Russia. But, unlike special envoy Steve Witkoff who was credited for the release, Ratcliffe\u2019s involvement in those talks was not widely publicized. Ratcliffe\u2019s approach to his job stands in stark contrast to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has issued agency-wide directives via social media posts on X and in public pronouncements on Fox News \u2013 a difference in style that has not gone unnoticed by career intelligence officials. Ratcliffe has also not made the kind of high-profile blunders that led to the dismissal of former national security advisor Mike Waltz, who added a journalist to a sensitive Signal chat about war planning, and additional scrutiny of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, whose classified texts to the chat churned headlines for days. However, Ratcliffe\u2019s presence and contribution to the now-infamous unsecure chat did raise eyebrows inside the CIA for its sensitive nature. Intelligence sources said there was anger and disbelief that there had been such carelessness using Signal instead of secure communications. Officials were also concerned that sources and methods were revealed. \u201cIt was obvious it was either a human source or drones. Either way, not OK,\u201d said a former high-ranking intelligence official. There are signs that Ratcliffe is walking a fine line: Trump has on at least one occasion expressed frustration that Ratcliffe is not moving faster to fire workers, reorganize the agency, and undo changes made under President Barack Obama, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trump did have some initial skepticism about Ratcliffe before his inauguration, another source familiar with the dynamic acknowledged. However, this person said that, as far as they know, the president has not said anything negative about his CIA director since entering the White House for his second term. Ratcliffe has taken some visible steps toward implementing Trump\u2019s vision. He has fired some probationary employees and other officers involved in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; he has also dismissed a senior official who had been targeted by a far-right activist. Many of those officials have challenged their firings in court and legal proceedings are ongoing. Related article\nOfficials say texts sent by Waltz, Ratcliffe in Signal chat may have damaged US\u2019 ongoing ability to gather intel on Houthis In March, Ratcliffe also welcomed Elon Musk to the agency\u2019s headquarters for a briefing and publicly commemorated the visit with a photo of the two men standing next to the famous CIA seal. \u201cHe fired all the DEI employees even though they sued. He offered the \u2018fork in the road\u2019 DOGE email, even though CIA had been exempt, then went over and above and offered early retirement. Then he proactively invited Elon out to the agency and talked to him about DOGE ideas he had,\u201d a person who works closely with Ratcliffe said, emphasizing Ratcliffe\u2019s attempts to please Trump. And Ratcliffe has allies in the White House: Two sources familiar with the dynamic said Ratcliffe has become \u201ctight\u201d with Vice President JD Vance. Ratcliffe\u2019s relationship with Vance dates back to before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, one of the sources said, noting the two men had several conversations about reforming the CIA prior to assuming their current roles in the president\u2019s second administration. That balancing act has made it hard for rank-and-file CIA officers \u2013 many of whom are anxious about their careers \u2013 to judge how much to trust the new director, who multiple sources said has kept the flow of information inside the agency restricted to an extremely tight inner circle. In one instance, career officials were pleased to hear that a 35-year veteran of the agency was a top candidate to head the CIA\u2019s operational wing \u2013 only to be disappointed when he was not given the role. Within the building, the episode left the impression that the candidate, Ralph Goff, who has been outspoken in support of Ukraine, was insufficiently supportive of the president and his views on the conflict there. The episode is an example that \u201cthe whole building is on tenterhooks because they don\u2019t have any idea what is going to happen next,\u201d said the former high-ranking intelligence official. Ratcliffe is still expected to make widespread cuts at the CIA that officials said appear tailored to elevate the role of covert operations and human intelligence gathering. Ratcliffe, Ellis and other top officials are also holding meetings on a proposed reorganization of the agency that would combine existing offices under a new \u201cAmericas\u201d Mission Center to prioritize counternarcotics and counter-cartel work \u2013 previously a relatively small part of the agency\u2019s mission but a top priority under Trump. The CIA under Trump has been flying unarmed surveillance drone missions over Mexican airspace and reviewing its legal authorities to conduct lethal action against cartels \u2013 a frequent topic of conversation at the White House, according to a source familiar with the matter. Ratcliffe has made clear that one of his top priorities as CIA director is refocusing the agency on covert action and collecting human intelligence. \u201cWe will collect intelligence \u2013 especially human intelligence \u2013 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult. We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgement or infect our products,\u201d Ratcliffe told Senate lawmakers during his confirmation hearing earlier this year. Related article\nCIA flying covert drone missions into Mexico to spy on drug cartels \u201cWe will conduct covert action at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do,\u201d he said. Ratcliffe\u2019s plans also include shrinking the agency\u2019s workforce by about 1,200 personnel over the next several years through a combination of early retirement, deferred resignations, and reduced hiring, according to a source familiar with the matter. In total, the planned cuts will affect between 5-6% of the CIA\u2019s total workforce, the source added. But the changes are unlikely to impact hiring at CIA\u2019s Directorate of Operations, according to the source familiar with the matter. Instead, the effort appears likely to include cutting some positions currently held by analysts at the agency, suggesting a clear prioritization of officials who operate in the field over those who work to make sense of multiple streams of intelligence, according to current and former US officials. That goal aligns with the vision outlined for the CIA in a Trump transition planning document obtained by CNN, which details how the new administration should limit analysts\u2019 ability to influence decisions related to covert operations and reassert control over those programs to ensure they are aligned with the president\u2019s policy goals. The agency is reevaluating what were known as the \u201cBrennan reforms\u201d \u2013 named for former CIA Director John Brennan \u2013 which integrated analysts with the agency\u2019s operations officers. Critics of the move have long argued that having the two roles work together compromised hard-nosed analysis. Some covert officers have also long contended that the move weakened the agency\u2019s elite spies, elevating analysts at their expense. Under Trump, those voices appear to have gained an audience.

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/john-roberts-event-judicial-independence",
      "content": "Chief Justice John Roberts stressed the importance of judicial independence during public remarks Wednesday, noting that the judiciary\u2019s role as a co-equal branch of government is central to the nation\u2019s political system. \u201cThe judiciary is a coequal branch of government, separate from the others with the authority to interpret the Constitution as law, and strike down, obviously, acts of Congress or acts of the president,\u201d Roberts said at an event in his native Buffalo, New York. The judiciary\u2019s role, Roberts added, is to \u201cdecide cases but, in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or the executive.\u201d That work, Roberts said, \u201cdoes require a degree of independence.\u201d Roberts\u2019 remarks on the judiciary drew an extended round of applause from the judges and lawyers who gathered in Western New York to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the federal court there. The chief justice was born in Buffalo but moved to Indiana when he was 10 years old. Roberts, who in September will mark his 20th year as chief, did not mention President Donald Trump by name, nor did he directly discuss the tension between the executive and judicial branches that has surfaced since the president took office in January. Asked about calls by Trump and some of his allies to impeach judges who rule against his administration, Roberts noted that he had issued a statement on that issue earlier this year. \u201cImpeachment is not how you register disagreement with decisions,\u201d he said. Related article\nJohn Roberts has enabled Trump. Now he hopes to restrain him Roberts delivered a rare rebuke to the president in March, issuing the statement in response to calls at the time to impeach judges who have placed some parts of his agenda on hold, including the administration\u2019s rapid rewriting of federal immigration policies and its efforts to reduce government spending approved by Congress. \u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\u201d Roberts said in his earlier statement. \u201cThe normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\u201d In recent public remarks, Trump has been more careful to specifically vow to honor future Supreme Court rulings \u2013 even as he has continued to rail against judges who rule against him. But in a number of high-profile cases, including one involving a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, the administration has interpreted any ambiguity to its advantage. Roberts, who has frequently raised the importance of judicial independence in the past, made no mention of the large number of cases involving Trump\u2019s second term that have landed on the Supreme Court\u2019s emergency docket in recent months, including appeals involving the firing of board members at independent agencies and the controversial effort to deport some migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. One of the highest profile cases now pending at the court involves Trump\u2019s order to effectively end birthright citizenship. After lower courts blocked the administration from moving forward, the administration has asked the justices to significantly limit who would be protected by those lower court orders. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in that case on May 15. Most of Roberts\u2019 remarks Wednesday stuck to familiar themes, though the chief justice did briefly defend decisions that overturn precedent. Though Roberts did not discuss specific modern cases, his court has received significant blowback \u2013 and sagging public approval \u2013 for its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. \u201cA lot of people talk as if we\u2019re overruling a lot more. It\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been since the \u201950s,\u201d Roberts said. And some cases, Roberts said, should be overruled. \u201cThe idea that its invariably a bad thing to overrule precedent is, I think, quite mistaken,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the same time, you can\u2019t do it willy nilly.\u201d Asked by US District Judge Lawrence Vilardo if he ever thought about retiring, Roberts shot back flatly: \u201cNo.\u201d The chief justice, who turned 70 this year, then launched into a discussion about how he might make that calculation some day. If he recognized, at some point, that he was a burden to the court, he said, maybe that would be different. Roberts said he once asked \u201cvery good friends\u201d to let him know if they ever felt it was time for him to step down. After a long pause, Roberts said, both friends simultaneously joked that it was already time. For now, Roberts said, he felt \u201cpretty healthy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going out feet first,\u201d he said. This story has been updated with additional information.",

      "content": "A federal judge pressed the Justice Department on President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that he could secure the return of migrants deported to a Salvadoran super prison, during a Wednesday evening hearing where the judge approved more fact-finding into whether the US has custody over the migrants it sent to the prison. US District Judge James Boasberg is considering a dispute stemming from Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, but he brought up the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2013 who was wrongly deported to El Salvador under a different immigration authority and whose case is in front of a different judge \u2013 as he weighs a request from the migrants before him that they be returned to the US so they can have the opportunity to challenge Trump\u2019s use of the sweeping wartime authority against them. \u201cDidn\u2019t the president say just last week that he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia just by picking up the phone and asking El Slavador to release him \u2013 so is the president telling the truth?\u201d Boasberg asked an attorney for the Justice Department. DOJ attorney Abhishek Kambli did not answer the question directly, prompting frustration from Boasberg. He instead claimed that Trump\u2019s comments spoke to \u201cthe president\u2019s belief of the influence he has.\u201d The belief doesn\u2019t negate the idea that El Salvador ultimately has control, Kambli argued. Before Boasberg decides whether the migrants in his case should be returned, he first must decide if the US even has custody of them now that they\u2019re in the Salvadoran prison. \u201cI think plaintiffs may well have sufficiently made out a case for constructive custody,\u201d he said at one point during the hearing Wednesday afternoon but added that he wanted more information to help him make a decision on the question. Boasberg is first requesting that the Trump administration put forward any declarations or documents by Friday that would back up its claims that the US government does not have custody of the migrants. Lawyers for the migrants will then be able to request any additional discovery \u2013 though the judge said he would only allow for a very \u201ccabined\u201d inquiry \u2013 that would help him make his decision. He said he would issue an order on Thursday that will give more detail about how the process will move forward.",

      "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/07/politics/kennedy-center-les-mis-cast-boycott-trump",
      "content": "When President Donald Trump descends on the Kennedy Performing Arts Center next month for a high-dollar fundraiser and a performance of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d he won\u2019t be seeing the usual cast performing, sources told CNN. At least 10 to 12 performers in Les Mis are planning to sit out the show on June 11, the night that Trump attends at the Kennedy Center, the sources said. The cast was given the option to not perform the night Trump will be in the audience, and both major cast members and members of the ensemble are among those sitting out, according to the sources. The move highlights friction between the Trump administration and members within the center as the president has made an aggressive push to reshape it, thrusting the Washington, DC-based performing arts complex into the middle of culture wars. The boycott follows Trump\u2019s decision to effectively take control of the Kennedy Center as part of a widespread effort his administration has undertaken to bend American institutions \u2013 including cultural, legal and educational pillars \u2013 to the president\u2019s will. Less than a month into his presidency, Trump installed himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center thanks to a newly constituted board, including several new Trump appointees who replaced trustees appointed by Democratic presidents. He also named Richard Grenell, a longtime confidant already serving in multiple administration positions, to the director role earlier this year. The same night that Trump will attend the performance of Les Mis, he will also hold a fundraiser to benefit the Kennedy Center. The fundraiser was first reported by ABC News. \u201cWe are definitely using the Les Mis opening as an opportunity\u201d to shore up the center\u2019s finances, one person familiar with the plans told CNN. During his 2016 campaign, Trump used music from Les Mis during his campaign rallies, which the co-creators of the musical objected to, according to the Guardian. In a statement to CNN, Grennell, who identified himself as president of the Kennedy Center, said he was unaware that some cast members planned to boycott the performance on the night of Trump\u2019s appearance and that the Kennedy Center will \u201cno longer fund intolerance.\u201d \u201cAny performer who isn\u2019t professional enough to perform for patrons of all backgrounds, regardless of political affiliation, won\u2019t be welcomed,\u201d said Grennell. \u201cIn fact, we think it would be important to out those vapid and intolerant artists to ensure producers know who they shouldn\u2019t hire - and that the public knows which shows have political litmus tests to sit in the audience. The Kennedy Center wants to be a place where people of all political stripes sit next to each other and never ask who someone voted for but instead enjoys a performance together.\u201d CNN reached out for comment to the Kennedy Center, the company producing Les Mis and the union that represents the cast members. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has both publicly and privately complained about the state of the Kennedy Center, while Grenell previously asserted that it has \u201cno cash on hand, no reserves.\u201d \u201cNO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA \u2014 ONLY THE BEST,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social in February. \u201cRIC, WELCOME TO SHOW BUSINESS!\u201d Artists including Issa Rae, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds have resigned from their leadership roles or canceled events at the space in response to the changes, while the center has canceled performances, including the tour of the children\u2019s musical \u201cFinn.\u201d A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center told CNN, \u201c\u2018Finn\u2019, which was not yet announced, was canceled for financial reasons PRIOR to the change in Kennedy Center leadership. The authors were also notified prior to the change.\u201d \u201cFinn\u201d was commissioned by the Kennedy Center in 2023. In February, one of the show\u2019s co-creators, Michael Kooman, told the Washington Post that before the board met to change the Kennedy Center\u2019s leadership, the \u201cFinn\u201d creative team received a phone call from the center telling it the tour was canceled because \u201cthe financials weren\u2019t working out,\u201d Kooman said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to ignore the circumstances in which the cancellation of the tour is happening,\u201d he added. High-profile shows like \u201cHamilton,\u201d meanwhile, scrapped planned performances at the Kennedy Center after Trump\u2019s takeover. During a visit to the center in March, Trump criticized Hamilton, the hit musical written by Lin-Manuel Miranda that is a modern telling of the country\u2019s founding through the eyes of Alexander Hamilton, including a multi-ethnic cast. \u201cI never liked Hamilton very much,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cBut we are going to have some really good shows,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI would say this, come here and watch it, and you\u2019ll see, over a period of time, it\u2019ll improve very greatly physically. And we\u2019re going to get some very good shows. The thing that does well are Broadway hits.\u201d This story has been updated with new information.",

The document, which is believed to be a leaked cabinet memorandum, proposes major constitutional changes. Among them: scrapping a section of the constitution that prevents sitting leaders from extending their terms; a move that could allow President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputies to stay in power until 2031. Other proposals include giving Parliament up to three more years beyond its current five-year limit and shifting control of voter registration from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to the Registrar of Births and Deaths. Speaking exclusively to NewsHub, the minister dismissed the document as fake and slammed social media users for spreading what he called \u201cfalse documents.\u201d He made it clear that if any constitutional changes were coming, they would be done transparently and not in the shadows. \u201cI am sick and tired of social media manufacturing and circulating these false documents. This is not the process the government follows when passing a bill. The bill is a public document, and there is no need to get excited. When the government has finalised it, it will be in the public domain for debate. As the government, if we propose a bill, we do not do so in secrecy. The procedure is public,\u201d he said. While denying that the viral document was legitimate, Ziyambi hinted that Zanu PF might still be working on its own constitutional changes behind the scenes. \u201cMine is coming, wait for it. I do not discuss these matters in secrecy. When it is released, you will see it, and it will be gazetted, not these fabricated documents,\u201d he said.

Mashatile was returning from an ANC meeting in Boksburg when shots were fired at his convoy. At first, he thought someone was throwing stones at his car. But it quickly became clear that it was gunfire. Speaking during a visit to Greater Ivory Park Zone 15 in Soweto, where he was honouring freedom fighters who were killed by police in 1987, Mashatile addressed the issue head-on. He was asked by eNCA journalist Pule Letshwiti-Jones why his security hadn\u2019t been beefed up following the incident. Mashatile explained that security decisions are not up to him or the President. Those calls are made by the country\u2019s security agencies. He explained: \u201cWell, the President and Deputy President don\u2019t determine their security. It\u2019s an assessment done by the security cluster. At the moment, we are convinced that both the President and Deputy President have adequate security. If they think they need to beef up, they will do so.\u201d While Mashatile downplayed the need for changes, police leadership has already taken action behind the scenes. In a statement issued Tuesday night, police commissioner Fannie Masemola\u2019s spokesperson, Athlenda Mathe, confirmed that extra protection had been deployed for both President Cyril Ramaphosa and his deputy. \u201cGeneral Fannie Masemola confirms the reinforcement of security detail to both principals and has also expressed gratitude with the manner in which members of the Presidential Protection Service (PPS) safeguard and handle the safety of both principals. Members of the PPS who are assigned to both the President and the Deputy President are trained to a high level of skill and possess the necessary expertise and capabilities to avert any risk and threat.

The announcement marks a dramatic escalation in Geza\u2019s strategy following the failed 31 March street protests and the initial call for a shutdown on 22 and 23 April 2025. Instead of a short-lived demonstration, Geza now says the country must grind to a complete and indefinite halt. Blessed Geza speech\n\u2013 Stayaway now indefinite until ED steps down\n\u2013 he says shops should give people food for free. They will be compensated by the new govt\n\u2013 people will be told where to get food in due course pic.twitter.com/aCuRQKTz6b \u2014 Zim Media Review (@ZimMediaReview) April 21, 2025  According to Geza, the indefinite shutdown is the only remaining peaceful method for Zimbabweans to express their frustration with the ruling ZANU-PF government. He instructed workers, teachers, transport operators, vendors, and business owners to withdraw their labour and stay home until the regime collapses. He said that the indefinite shutdown would show the world that Zimbabweans had lost confidence in Mnangagwa\u2019s leadership. In his message, Geza insisted that shops should remain closed, public transport should stay off the roads, and schools and industries must not open their doors. The country, he argued, must stop functioning entirely to force political change. Geza believes the government is now attempting to consolidate power by illegally extending the president\u2019s term of office. He alleged that Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, Attorney General Virginia Mabhiza, and Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda were spearheading plans to push Mnangagwa\u2019s rule to 2030 without a constitutional referendum. He claimed the government would try to offer term extensions to MPs as a way to buy their silence and support. In response to these claims, Geza made it clear that the stay-away would continue without interruption until a new administration takes over. Following the arrest of over 100 activists during the March demonstrations, Geza has turned to civil disobedience rather than street protests. He explained that peaceful resistance through non-participation was now the only safe way to protest in Zimbabwe, where the security forces have been accused of using brutal methods to shut down opposition. He argued that the judiciary, Parliament, and the police have all been captured by the executive, making traditional protest methods ineffective. In his view, by staying indoors and refusing to participate in the economy, Zimbabweans could cripple the state without putting themselves in harm\u2019s way. Geza, who is still on the run from police, said the authorities could not arrest people for choosing to stay at home. He believes that by shutting down the country\u2019s daily operations, Zimbabweans would paralyse the system and highlight the failure of leadership without lifting a single placard. He acknowledged the risk and hardship that comes with an indefinite shutdown, particularly for those in the informal sector. However, he urged the population to make short-term sacrifices for long-term change, saying Zimbabweans could no longer afford to wait. The reaction from the public has been mixed. While some have shown support for the indefinite stay-away, calling it a powerful act of resistance, others expressed concern that such a strategy would worsen the economic crisis for ordinary people. Many Zimbabweans earn a living through informal trade and casual labour, and staying at home indefinitely could result in massive hunger and suffering. Some have proposed more strategic action, such as regular stay-aways once a week to build momentum without collapsing livelihoods. Others have warned that the government may respond with heavy-handed tactics if the protest starts to affect the flow of money or public perception. Despite this, Geza appears unmoved and determined. He has doubled down on his demands, stating that the only acceptable outcome is the complete removal of Mnangagwa and his allies from power. Until that happens, he says Zimbabwe must remain silent, ungovernable, and immobile. The government has not officially responded to Geza\u2019s latest threats, but security forces are expected to be on high alert starting Monday, 22 April 2025, when the shutdown is set to begin.

      "content": "The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Profanity has always been the heart and soul of Guy Ritchie\u2019s tough guy offerings, but his new Paramount show is saturated in so many c-words that it may just have ushered in the death of swearing. Helen Coffey mourns the senseless dilution of our most beloved curse word I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice When I started watching MobLand, Guy Ritchie\u2019s new London gangster drama featuring an all-star cast including Dame Helen Mirren, Tom Hardy and Pierce Brosnan, I initially thought the most ridiculous thing in it was the accents. There\u2019s Brosnan\u2019s preposterous \u201cIrish\u201d brogue for starters \u2013 even more inexplicable when you consider that the man actually is Irish \u2013 an amalgamation of every terrible \u201ctop o\u2019 the mornin\u2019 to ya!\u201d impression you\u2019ve ever heard, and arguably even worse than his much-mocked turn in the 1988 film Taffin. Then there\u2019s Mirren\u2019s equally scattergun attempt at convincing us she hails from the Emerald Isle, not to mention the myriad botched cockney dialects that frequently threaten to tip over into full Dick Van Dyke territory. But before long, another element in the buzzy new Paramount show, centred around the Harrigan crime family, vied for top dog in the \u201csuspend your disbelief\u201d Olympics. The first time it happened was nine minutes and 45 seconds into episode one: the c-word, flung out in a gritty East End nightclub, the mobster equivalent of a glove slap as the precursor to a duel. Another one landed five seconds later. A third swiftly followed. A brief spell of furious running from Eddie Harrigan (Anson Boon), and then \u201cc***\u201d number four slid into view. At first, I took it in my stride. These are professional criminals, I reasoned; a little potty-mouthed dialogue is par for the course when you\u2019ve got a load of hardmen trying to out-hard each other while strutting around and flashing weaponry. Yet the repetition quickly became so frequent it began to feel a little\u2026 farcical. Silly, even. The word resembled an arbitrary punctuation mark, a kind of lazy shorthand for \u201cLook at us \u2013 we\u2019re ever so tough!\u201d Without even realising I was doing it, I stopped paying attention to the story and switched my focus to counting the \u201cc***s\u201d. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine\u2026 They stopped just shy of double digits in episode one, but I was on a roll now. I continued tallying with a kind of horrified fascination, as if doing an 18-rated version of Count von Count from Sesame Street\u2019s schtick. Episode two saw a dip in usage, with only two during the entire 50-minute runtime, but by episode three we were back, baby: another nine, shoehorned in with all the subtlety of a brick lobbed through a freshly glazed window. The undisputed winner, though, was episode five, the \u201cc***\u201ds coming thick and fast to reach a dizzying total of 11 \u2013 the equivalent of one every three minutes. Five of these were uttered in the final eight minutes alone. The word is used indiscriminately by nearly every character in the show, upon any and every occasion. Feeling lethally angry towards someone? Call them a c***. Mildly aggrieved? Call them a c***. Affectionate? Call them a c***. Sorry for them? Call them a poor c***. It would make an effective drinking game \u2013 take a shot every time you hear the c-word! \u2013 but only if your real aim was to end the evening in A&E getting your stomach pumped. It\u2019s like someone fed Peter Cook and Dudley Moore\u2019s infamous Derek and Clive Live \u201cThis Bloke Came Up To Me\u201d sketch \u2013 which contains an awe-inspiring 36 \u201cc***\u201ds within the space of three minutes and 40 seconds \u2013 into ChatGPT and asked it to burp out a 10-part gangster drama. By the time I\u2019d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word, let alone the most potent one in the English language. I had to catch myself before saying it casually to my mum on the phone; my boss over Slack; the unsuspecting woman on the checkout at Asda. I had to remind myself that calling someone a \u201cc***\u201d is not, in fact, an appropriate response to every situation.

The c-word has long been the undisputed king of swears, one that wields the mightiest power to offend, titillate and make people laugh depending on timing and context. The oldest word for female genitalia in the English language, this is profanity with some historical clout (though, admittedly, it wasn\u2019t offensive back in the 13th century when its first usage was recorded). It may be too much for many Americans\u2019 tastes, and have been watered down into a neutral or complimentary term by the Aussies (see: \u201cHe\u2019s a good c***\u201d), but most Brits hold the expletive in high esteem, understanding its expansive, unrivalled capacity to shock and endear. It\u2019s no coincidence that The White Lotus\u2019s English stars, Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood, both independently named it as their favourite curse word in recent interviews. By the time I\u2019d watched six episodes, it no longer even registered as a curse word Understand when and where to use it \u2013 shrewdly and with discernment \u2013 and it\u2019s like carrying the sharpest, most adaptable blade in your lexiconic arsenal at all times. National treasure Kathy Burke is the master of this, able to deftly deploy \u201cc***\u201d with the precision and comedic timing it needs to hit a home run. By comparison, MobLand isn\u2019t even attempting to make contact with the ball \u2013 simply lobbing bats across the field at random and hoping one of them hits something. I\u2019m not annoyed by the proliferation of profanity because I\u2019m offended by it. I\u2019m annoyed because MobLand has taken this most special of curses, in all its jagged, ugly elegance, and flogged it to death, diluting it through overexposure and robbing it of its muscle. The sheer abundance of \u201cc***\u201ds ensures they don\u2019t punch through or enhance the dialogue. Instead, they awkwardly stumble across the screen: flabby, toothless, a little embarrassing. It\u2019s like seeing a once-proud empress dethroned and wandering the streets in rags. My heart aches for her. It\u2019s ironic, in a way. In a drama dominated by senseless gangland killings, the murder of our beloved c-word turned out to be the most tragic of all.

      "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/10-things-i-hate-about-you-reboot-heath-ledger-b2746364.html",
      "content": "The director behind the 1999 teen classic has announced three sequels are in development, though sans the original\u2019s biggest star Heath Ledger, who died in 2008. And it\u2019s news that wildly misunderstands the appeal of the original, argues Adam White I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice Heath Ledger in 10 Things I Hate About You remains one of the key definitions of a \u201cstar is born\u201d performance. Tall, handsome, with blush-worthy levels of camera-ready magnetism, Ledger sauntered into pop-culture consciousness in 1999 as a chain-smoking (rumoured) bad boy teen paid to take an arty cool girl (the similarly luminous Julia Stiles) to prom. Allowed to retain his Aussie accent, Ledger is ludicrously charismatic in the film, all lackadaisical flirtation and alluring ambivalence. Can you even imagine 10 Things\u2026 without him? Well, imagine no more: a Heath-less reboot is in development. Is nothing sacred etc...? Despite celebrity deaths typically halting unasked-for revivals in their tracks (remember how close we got to a second Mrs Doubtfire in the months before Robin Williams\u2019s death in 2014?), a trilogy of sequels to 10 Things I Hate About You is coming down the pipe. The original film\u2019s director Gil Junger has confirmed that each new movie will explore different stages of adult life, which will be reflected in their respective titles: 10 Things I Hate About Dating; 10 Things I Hate About Marriage; and 10 Things I Hate About Kids. How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways. Junger said that he is open to cast members from the first film returning for \u201ccameos\u201d or \u201csmall parts\u201d, mentioning Larry Miller by name \u2013 the actor who played father to Stiles\u2019s moody wallflower. Absent, though, obviously, would be Ledger, who died in 2008 at the depressingly young age of 28. But don\u2019t worry, Junger told People Magazine, it\u2019d be \u201ca beautiful idea\u201d to somehow nod to Ledger in the new movies, adding: \u201cHe deserves to be loved.\u201d Sure! But isn\u2019t there something particularly grim about this, even for an age in which absolutely every bit of pre-existing intellectual property (IP) \u2013 The Bodyguard (maybe) with Taylor Swift! Single White Female with Jenna Ortega! Legally Blonde without Reese Witherspoon! \u2013 is being strip-mined for parts? 10 Things wasn\u2019t a film led by its premise, which more or less mirrored the conventions of every other major teen movie in 1999: finding love through deception, prom night entanglements, enemies to lovers, Shakespeare-aping silliness (as any GCSE English student will tell you, its plot was inspired by The Taming of the Shrew). What made it a generational classic was Ledger and Stiles, two preternaturally gifted young actors with intelligence and wit in spades, along with the particularly skilled cast that surrounded them (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gabrielle Union and David Krumholtz). And it was also down to the unusually thoughtful, character-driven script by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith, who made sure that Stiles\u2019s moody Kat Stratford was never shamed for being a snarky, alternative bookworm, or transformed \u2013 She\u2019s All That-style \u2013 into something more aggressively conventional. McCullah and Smith are, at this point, not involved in the revival, suggesting this is very much a Gil Junger project. And you can hardly blame his eagerness. Junger, whose last significant movie was 2001\u2019s Martin Lawrence medieval romp Black Knight, has been attempting to mount 10 Things reboots since 2009, first with a short-lived TV series inspired by the film (you probably don\u2019t remember it either), then in 2012 with the film sequel 10 Things I Hate About Life starring Evan Rachel Wood. If that\u2019s inspired you to say \u201chuh?\u201d, it\u2019s because it never got finished \u2013 production was cancelled two months into filming. I understand the impulse for a filmmaker to try and further monetise his biggest hit, but 10 Things I Hate About You isn\u2019t an incredibly flexible bit of IP that can exist as little more than a brand name. It is specific and singular, something only crystallised by the death of its biggest name. I also can\u2019t see anyone being particularly interested in it, either. Without Ledger, there won\u2019t even be the slim pleasure of watching old castmates reuniting (which seems to be the sole impetus behind the forthcoming Freakier Friday with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan). It\u2019ll just be the most currently unemployed cast members from a perfect film from 25 years ago, vainly attempting to resurrect its magic \u2013 and what a miserable idea that is.

      "content": "The comedy drama returns with more irreverent fun and a very human sense of chaos and jeopardy I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice The vintage Plymouth Barracuda rolls on. Fittingly, it\u2019s slightly tatty but it has a vibe all of its own. As we rejoin Natasha Lyonne\u2019s hyper-charismatic human lie detector Charlie Cale, for a second season of what a narrative theorist would call inverted detective stories and we might think of as \u201chowcatchems\u201d, she\u2019s still racing across America. She has a casino owner and an organised crime gang on her tail (initially, at least, they seem both spectacularly dimwitted and are terribly poor shots), but as if that wasn\u2019t enough to cope with, she still can\u2019t stop running into murder mysteries and she still can\u2019t help solving them. Somehow though, she still seems to be having fun. And therefore, so are we. Poker Face (Sky Max) is, in current TV terms, something of an anomaly. Created by Knives Out director Rian Johnson, it proudly sets its stall out to entertain \u2013 which often doesn\u2019t feel like a given in the context of the labyrinthine longueurs of much streaming-era television. On the face of it, it\u2019s a simple show; a \u201ccase of the week\u201d throwback. While certain dramas wear narrative complexity like a badge of honour, Poker Face is as brisk, no-nonsense and free of airs and graces as the lead character herself. Like the shows it most obviously recalls (it\u2019s impossible not to mention Columbo at this point), it\u2019s deeply contrived. But the contrivances are a big part of the fun \u2013 sometimes they subvert conventions, sometimes they wink gleefully at them. Clues fall conveniently into Charlie\u2019s lap and, for some reason, it works. Often, during her reveals, she\u2019ll pace the room; a woman performing Peter Falk karaoke and inviting viewers to laugh fondly along with her. And yet Poker Face never tips over into self-indulgence \u2013 alongside its style and wit, it carries real emotional weight too. This is almost entirely down to Lyonne, whose wry, weary resilience sustains the show. \u201cIntrospection makes me queasy,\u201d says Charlie. And it\u2019s easy to imagine why \u2013 Charlie doesn\u2019t understand her own gift for sniffing out bull**** and nor does she particularly welcome it. Instead, these situations find her as she ricochets from town to town and job to job; taking on temporary work that ranges from fruit picking to Halloween zombie enactment. With kind eyes and a voice like sandpaper, she elicits confidences from almost everyone she meets. And that\u2019s really her problem: she\u2019s incapable of ignoring people and even less able to avoid empathising. Across this second series, her inner life and backstory start to manifest themselves, even if she\u2019d rather they didn\u2019t. In the meantime, she revels in what she describes, somewhat self-mockingly, as \u201cthe unobserved pageant of the ordinary\u201d. The individual cases themselves are beautifully realised and this is key to the show\u2019s consistency. At their best, and like the finest literary short stories, they offer brief but total immersion in a fully imagined world. Take the series opener, featuring a bravura performance from Cynthia Erivo, who plays five parts, often simultaneously. Amber (Erivo) and her quadruplet sisters (Erivo) were child actors \u2013 the rotating stars of cheesy but beloved TV show Kid Cop. They were cheated of their rightful fortunes by their scheming mother who is about to die. Amber, who has devoted her life to caring for this cruel, selfish woman, decides she deserves the bulk of the inheritance. But how far might she be prepared to go to get it? With the episode\u2019s head-spinning identity swaps and layers of multiplying subterfuge, it is, in what feels like a deliberate nod to Lyonne\u2019s breakthrough lead show, a true Russian doll of a storyline. And so it goes on. Charlie quits town again, heading to a funeral home, then a school talent show, then an alligator farm. And what initially feels like repetition soon begins to feel like a deepening of intention. It\u2019s lightly carried and never clumsily forced but even so, there\u2019s a fairly serious examination of the concept of truth going on here. Most of the people Charlie meets have created different personas to help them deal with themselves. \u201cYou call it a lie, I call it my truth,\u201d as Amber says. But is Charlie really any different? Opposing versions of truth unfold wherever she goes, and she detects them unfailingly, but Charlie is on the run from reality too. While Poker Face is awash with memorable cameos \u2013 this time, expect Awkwafina, Method Man, Giancarlo Esposito and many more \u2013 the most telling is Rhea Perlman\u2019s casino owner Beatrix Hasp. Beatrix represents grim destiny, the end of the road for Charlie. Poker Face never dodges reality (and how could it, given its premise?), but it never stumbles under its own weight either. This show is irreverent fun with a big moral heart and a very human sense of chaos and jeopardy, and it never forgets to give us what we need. How much longer can the Barracuda keep rolling? With Charlie at the wheel, I hope we have a long road trip ahead of us. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",

      "content": "This theatre landmark has been around for 20 years, but it still continues to create something new and uncomfortable It\u2019s been 20 years since Tim Crouch\u2019s experimental theatre landmark An Oak Tree first premiered, with hundreds of actors taking on the challenge over the decades, but this anniversary production still feels winningly tender and tentative, not authoritative. Each night, Crouch guides a different performer through a script they\u2019ve never seen before. And as they stumble over unfamiliar lines, he performs a magic trick: transforming their real discomfort into the crackling tension between two characters bound together by grief and guilt. On opening night at the Young Vic, it\u2019s the wonderful Irish actor Jessie Buckley braving the stage, one of a formidably starry line-up that also includes Adjoa Andoh, David Tennant, Meera Syal and Russell Tovey. And no wonder: for these massive actors, it\u2019s a test. A risk. A way of injecting liveness and spontaneity into careers running along smooth rails. Buckley feels especially exposed on stage, her visible pregnancy adding a level of vulnerability that\u2019s countered by the confident way she throws herself into the part \u2013 she falls to her knees playing uproariously virtuoso air piano, and when Crouch says \u201cAin\u2019t she beautiful?\u201d, she waggles her tongue mock-lasciviously and caresses her rounded torso. He\u2019s in persona as a creepy stage hypnotist, dressed in a silvery waistcoat and playing naff disco muzak over his speakers. And she plays everyone else \u2013 all the audience members at his failing, faltering gig \u2013 and Andy, a middle-aged man whose daughter this fumbling entertainer seems to have accidentally killed. Watching An Oak Tree is sometimes \u2013 often! \u2013 an uncomfortable, frustrating experience. More than once, Crouch\u2019s words are inaudible over the sound of piped traffic noise: at other moments, he stutters, heightening the artificiality of this entertainer\u2019s patter by not letting it feel suave or confident. \u201cAre you OK? Say yes,\u201d this weird, bald puppet-master instructs Buckley, who doesn\u2019t have room to insert her own words into a script that takes her in increasingly uncomfortable directions. But then, grief takes control away, too. Crouch\u2019s most powerful writing comes when death stops haunting the edges of the play and crashes into its centre, instead, emotions collapsing into abstracts. \u201cShe spoke two concrete blocks in black... left them inside me to this day,\u201d says Andy, remembering what it felt like to hear the worst possible news. There are so many unsettling layers here, as Crouch switches the mood, steers us joltingly from one version of reality to another. But the potential chilliness of Crouch\u2019s formal experiment is subverted by Buckley\u2019s bubbling warmth and impulsivity \u2013 her nervous laughter, steely controlled stare, or unexpected hug of total relief. On another night, with another performer, it will feel totally different. But it\u2019ll stay evergreen, for the way it exposes theatre\u2019s oldest tricks \u2013 the power plays, the charm, the liveness, the risk \u2013 and repurposes them into something jarring and new.

Read our Privacy notice Ask me anything at all \u2013 I\u2019m really unoffendable!\u201d Emma Jane Unsworth has unwittingly uttered the phrase every interviewer longs to hear \u2013 though the invitation isn\u2019t that surprising. It feels reassuringly on brand for the author of some of the past decade\u2019s most daring and subversive books exploring the millennial and Gen X female experience. You only have to read Animals, her gritty, zeitgeist-capturing 2014 novel about two friends \u201cruining their bodies\u201d by living in a constant state of off-their-tits hedonism, to know that here sits a writer unafraid to grasp the nettle of boundary-pushing subject matter. Described as \u201cWithnail for girls\u201d by an admiring Caitlin Moran, the book was subsequently adapted into a feature film starring Holliday Grainger and Alia Shawkat. Unsworth\u2019s follow-up, 2020\u2019s Adults, traverses the thorny territory of miscarriage, mental health and social media addiction; her latest novel, the provocatively titled Slags, is an equally unflinching foray into first love, fantasy and sexual identity. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a bit scary, I think, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Unsworth says of her work. \u201cQuite often I\u2019m cringing when I\u2019m writing, and quite often I\u2019m terrified \u2013 like, \u2018shall I put this? Really?\u2019\u201d That rawness translates into realness on the page; Unsworth has a knack for sketching out nuanced characters who feel viscerally alive. Slags is no exception, told from the perspective of 41-year-old Sarah as she and her younger sister, Juliette, embark on a birthday road trip to Scotland, which segues into an uncomfortable yet poignant trip down memory lane. While Unsworth\u2019s women are often plagued by inner turmoil and darkness, they are also whip-smart and belly-laugh witty \u2013 unlike a lot of the wilting protagonists found in the trendy \u201csad girl\u201d literary trope. \u201cWe should be allowed to contain all these multitudes \u2013 able to be very funny, but also really troubled and lost and messy,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s what carries the momentum, the joy in that sharp dialogue.\u201d You can get away with a lot, she adds \u2013 and have characters doing \u201cpretty awful things\u201d \u2013 if you make them fun to be around. \u201cThen your readers will come along for the ride and enjoy it.\u201d Unsworth thrums with energy when I meet her at a London caf\u00e9 in the build-up to publication day. Clad in wide-legged, white pin-striped trousers with a matching waistcoat, she\u2019s the kind of effortlessly cool forty-something woman who would be intimidating were it not for her instant, disarming warmth. Pale skin is complemented by strawberry blonde curls, tamed and pulled away from her face; dark blue eyes are clear and bright as she talks a hundred miles a minute in her subtle Mancunian twang. \u201cA few weeks ago, I felt sick with nerves,\u201d she admits of Slags\u2019 forthcoming release. \u201cNow, I\u2019m calm. It\u2019s in the hands of the book gods.\u201d The book\u2019s plotleaps back and forth through time, oscillating between Sarah as an adult and as a teenager. Do we ever truly shake off the identity that is set for us in those formative years? \u201cI think we come of age over and over again in life,\u201d Unsworth answers thoughtfully. \u201cAnd I think at those points, that\u2019s when we feel like we\u2019re defined. That definition, when you\u2019re young, can be so shaped by other people, so much to do with what other people tell you that you are.\u201d Her own teen self was \u201cgobby\u201d, loud and attention-seeking \u2013 but she \u201cwasn\u2019t very solid\u201d. \u201cPart of the inspiration for the book was just wanting to make myself, the teenage me who\u2019s still inside, more resilient,\u201d Unsworth says. Fifteen-year-old Sarah fits the same mould. With so many hormones kicking around, she sizzles with power and confidence yet is quivering with fragility and innocence beneath the brash facade. It\u2019s an affliction that, Unsworth believes, impacts teenage girls no matter which era they\u2019re born in: \u201cYou have all this desire and a burning urge to express yourself and work out who you are and put yourself out there. But at the same time, you\u2019re really vulnerable.\u201d How can we empower and protect teenage girls at the same time? \u201cI feel like that\u2019s what we need to do, but I don\u2019t know what the answer is. The book is in some way an exploration of that dilemma.\u201d She posits that female fantasy could be one essential outlet, offering young women agency and autonomy in a world that often robs them of both. The young Sarah lives inside a world of romantic make-believe so potent it seems to warp the very fabric of reality to fit the narrative in her head. \u201cI think we\u2019re encouraged to feel ashamed of our fantasies, especially women,\u201d muses Unsworth. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dirty, silly word, all frilly knickers and s*** porn. But actually, fantasies can be so nourishing and valuable and strengthening. I\u2019ve definitely used them as such a healing place in my life.\u201d Since her own adolescence, Unsworth has had a \u201cbig recalibration of who I am and what I want\u201d about once a decade. Much of her former sense of identity was bound up in the vision of herself as the eternal \u201cparty girl\u201d, epitomised by the uncouth, seize-the-night double-act in Animals (\u201cI will always push the f***-it button. I love pushing the f***-it button,\u201d she jokes). Her writing frequently explores the relationship between female characters and their drinking and substance-taking; there\u2019s a fascination with the sometimes blurred distinction between addict and hedonist. Unsworth very much defines herself as the latter. For her, there\u2019s always been something inherently romantic about the idea of intoxication; it symbolises \u201cfreedom, a tipping point\u201d. \u201cAddiction is a trap and it\u2019s a disease, and it\u2019s a terrible thing that ruins whole families and lives,\u201d she says, \u201cbut for me, my relationship with drugs and alcohol has always been about oblivion. They represent a chaos that means you can be and do anything. It\u2019s almost like a place you go and disintegrate from everything that society expects you to be\u2026\u201d I speak as someone who constantly questions whether it was the right thing for me to have children But there are some societal expectations it\u2019s near-impossible to escape. Getting on it every night simply isn\u2019t compatible with Unsworth\u2019s current life as a mother of two young children and daughter of ageing parents; it\u2019s a gear shift that part of her has fought tooth and nail against, part of her has submitted to. \u201cParenting is its own kind of joy, and its own responsibility \u2013 my children need a lot from me physically right now.\u201d Having had kids in her late thirties, Unsworth both loves and wrestles with the role of \u201cmother\u201d. \u201cRegret is something that interests me,\u201d she says, \u201cAnd I speak as someone who constantly questions whether it was the right thing for me to have children personally, as well as feeling very grateful that they exist.\u201d While any big life decision feels heavy, the baby question is on a whole other level, she argues \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s such a gnarly one for women\u201d. As someone who feels the absurd weight of that choice increasing exponentially the closer I get to 40 myself, the observation hits home. It\u2019s a theme that\u2019s adroitly navigated in Slags. Sarah is a Gen X workaholic who\u2019s voluntarily single; her younger sister has done the marriage and kids thing. The former laments that \u201cit is so hard to walk the walk of being a childfree woman\u201d, even by choice \u2013 and though Unsworth is no longer walking that particular path herself, its challenges still resonate. \u201cIt\u2019s really insidious, the way that pressures are put onto women to do certain things and be a certain way by a certain age,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still advertised that it\u2019s more valuable to have a life if you\u2019re a mother, and that there\u2019s only one way to be a mother.\u201d But she has always fought to present a counter-narrative in her work \u2013 \u201cdifferent happy endings, different routes that are equally meaningful and valuable and fulfilling.\u201d What\u2019s perhaps most enchanting about Slags is the central relationship between the two sisters. It\u2019s gratifying to see in literature what has been deftly achieved on screen in recent years in shows such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabagand Aisling Bea\u2019s This Way Up: an irresistibly authentic depiction of the female sibling dynamic in all its knotty complexity.Sarah and Juliette hold a mirror up to one another, the only people schooled in their own secret language built on a lifetime of shared cultural references and experiences. Inspired by the relationship between Sarah and Juliette \u2013 they speak of a \u201cheart alarm\u201d, a golden thread attached to the ribs that runs between them \u2013 and my own sister/soulmate, I wonder aloud whether siblings can end up being the real loves of each other\u2019s lives. \u201cOh, completely,\u201d agrees Unsworth, herself a big sister (a status that, she believes, has defined every other relationship she\u2019s ever had). \u201cWho else do you have a shared history with like that?\u201d She describes the relationship she has with her younger sister \u2013 three years Unsworth\u2019s junior \u2013 as the \u201cmost complicated\u201d of her life. After growing up together, you\u2019re left with something that\u2019s \u201cextremely complex, durable, heartbreaking, terrifying but edifying,\u201d says the author. On top of \u201cbig sister\u201d, Unsworth has recently acquired two new labels following an ADHD and autism diagnosis last year. The former was expected; the latter, not so much. The revelation has prompted her to probe the interplay between neurodivergence and intoxication. \u201cIt\u2019s made me think about how much I\u2019ve used things like alcohol, because it\u2019s a coping mechanism, at parties and things like that \u2013 as well as really enjoying it.\u201d But there\u2019s undoubtedly been a generational shift when it comes to getting s***-faced. In Slags, Sarah is dabbling in sobriety but finds it painfully boring; she mourns \u201cthe slow limp of Saturday nights where no one went out any more to pound pavements with their passion or fury\u201d, noting that Gen Z prefer coffee and conversation to pubs and clubs. Though she\u2019s not judging the next generation, Unsworth doesn\u2019t necessarily believe the shift from binge-drinking to wellness culture has been as \u201chealthy\u201d as it sounds. Every now and then, you just need that big fire for your head \u201cThe ideas about what\u2019s beautiful and the way that women should look\u2026 sadly, it\u2019s not all this free and easy wellbeing goodness,\u201d she says. \u201cI actually think there\u2019s still a lot of pressure and a lot of anxiety, a lot of damage being done to people.\u201d She believes there\u2019s something to be said for letting go and losing control on occasion, arguing that a big night out can cut through life\u2019s noise and stresses. \u201cIt feels like a cleanse, when everything\u2019s razed to the ground,\u201d she says wistfully. \u201cEvery now and then, you just need that big fire for your head...\u201d A cognitive reset is as likely to come from the shocking temperature change between the beachside sauna and ice bath in Unsworth\u2019s adopted home town of Brighton as it is from mind-altering substances these days. But it might not be that way forever. She has a fantasy of herself in her seventies, running around Soho, drinking and dancing and having a wild old time. I can picture it too: silver curls untamed; eyes still clear and bright; a cocktail in one hand and a large glass of wine in the other. \u201cI think there\u2019ll always be a party girl in me,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s having a little bit of a nap at the moment \u2013 but she\u2019s going to be back on her feet raging again in the future.\u201d Slags is published by HarperCollins on 8 May Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",

      "content": "By end of the week, a jury is expected to be seated in the federal sex trafficking trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs. It\u2019s a stunning turn of events for the once kingmaker in music, a man who reached billionaire status as a rapper, producer and entrepreneur. Combs has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Regardless of the outcome, Combs\u2019 legal troubles won\u2019t end with his criminal trial. He\u2019s facing more than 60 civil lawsuits in which he is accused of sexual assault or other wrongdoing. Combs has denied all the allegations. Attorney Andrew Van Arsdale, who represents 37 individuals who have already filed civil claims of sexual assault against Combs, told CNN in an exclusive interview that he has more than 400 new potential civil claims. The attorney said he intends to file civil claims against Combs after his criminal trial, largely because his clients are fearful of possible retaliation if the embattled music industry vet walks free. \u201cFrom my clients\u2019 perspective, the reason that they were so hesitant to come forward for so long in many cases was because of the power that this individual wielded and the threats to their professional opportunities that they felt he could create,\u201d Van Arsdale said. \u201cI do think there\u2019s an idea that, \u2018Oh my gosh, what if, what if he isn\u2019t found guilty of these charges, right? What if he\u2019s back on the streets in two months? What would have happened to me if I had made these allegations?\u201d \u201cI hear about it every day,\u201d he added. \u201cOur clients are still scared.\u201d Van Arsdale operates a call center through his company, Reciprocity Industries, which is based in Billings, Montana. The company was established in 2008, long before allegations began mounting against Combs. For years, the center has helped sift through callers\u2019 grievances across legal issues ranging from natural disaster recovery to sexual assault claims, assisting law firms with processing complaints for litigation and by marketing the hotline as an avenue through which firms can obtain potential clients. According to the company\u2019s website, Reciprocity employs more than 150 legal intake professionals and the company\u2019s services have been retained by over 500 law firms in the United States. Van Arsdale has litigated claims of sexual abuse against the Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic church. His law firm, AVA Law Group, represents dozens of alleged victims of Combs who were discovered through his Reciprocity call center, which the New York Times recently reported was the \u201ccentral collection point\u201d for sexual assault allegations against Combs. Records of incoming calls show Reciprocity Industries has received nearly 27,000 calls related to Combs, Van Arsdale said. After dismissing\u202fprank calls and unrelated or unreliable inquiries, his company estimates roughly 15,000 calls included claims of mistreatment by Combs. Through what he described as a rigorous vetting process, Van Arsdale said he believes there are more than 400 new, potential civil cases. At a press conference in October, his call center\u2019s 1-800 number was emblazoned behind Van Arsdale and his co-counsel, Houston-based attorney Tony Buzbee, who has become a primary target of Combs\u2019 defense. Combs\u2019 lawyers have called attorneys like Van Arsdale \u201cambulance chasers.\u201d Van Arsdale defends his company\u2019s 1-800 advertising as a means for alleged victims to access the justice system. \u201cYes, we need a big system in order to handle the influx of phone calls, and yes, we need very serious vetting in order to make sure we\u2019re bringing the claims that need to be handled in the civil court of law forward, but that is what this process is,\u201d Van Arsdale said. \u201cAnd they can no longer hide behind the victim shaming, even though they continue to try to do that.\u201d CNN has reached out to Combs\u2019 team for comment regarding Van Arsdale\u2019s claim that he is working on hundreds of additional potential civil suits. Previously, Combs\u2019 lawyers told CNN that he has \u201cnever sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone \u2013 man or woman, adult or minor.\u201d \u201cNo number of lawsuits, sensationalized allegations, or media theatrics will change that reality,\u201d they added in a statement at the time. It\u2019s not just Van Arsdale who is going up against Combs. At least a dozen attorneys are representing plaintiffs who have filed civil claims against Combs. The majority of the accusers\u2019 claims are unrelated, spanning across decades with alleged incidents occurring at various locations across different states. Out of the 60-plus civil cases already filed against Combs, two have been withdrawn \u2013 one, filed by an anonymous Jane Doe who declined a court order to reveal her identity, and another against Combs and Jay-Z, which was voluntarily withdrawn by the Jane Doe after Jay-Z adamantly denied her claims and a number of inconsistencies surfaced with her account. Combs\u2019 team has seized on inconsistencies in at least two of Van Arsdale\u2019s clients\u2019 accounts: the Jane Doe who accused Combs and Jay-Z, and an anonymous male accuser who gave details in a December 2024\u202finterview with CNN that didn\u2019t match his lawsuit, including the year he alleges he was drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs at one of his White Parties. Van Arsdale said the inconsistencies in John Doe\u2019s story were due to a clerical error in filing. After CNN\u2019s interview with John Doe, his firm refiled an amended complaint. Though the civil and criminal cases are separate, Van Arsdale said some of his clients have cooperated with federal authorities in the Combs criminal case and could be called to testify during his trial. \u201cThis is an opportunity they maybe thought they\u2019d never had in the fact that they see the system working,\u201d he said. Van Arsdale said he is seeking justice for his clients regardless of the outcome of the criminal trial. \u201cMy clients will be ecstatic if and when he\u2019s convicted, guilty and behind bars,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the next step in their healing process is the accountability for what happened to them.\u201d",

      "content": "Days into Harvey Weinstein \u2018s first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her. But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola\u2019s claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women\u2019s accusations. On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story, according to the Associated Press. Sokola didn\u2019t look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he\u2019s on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction last year, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola\u2019s allegations. As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them. The Polish-born Sokola, 39, is a psychotherapist and author and said she recently launched a film production company. She sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation. Sokola testified that she was never interested in modeling \u2013 but rather in acting and writing \u2013 but her mother and sister decided she should enter a Polish modeling contest at age 14. She won a contract with a modeling agency and was soon juggling middle school with photo shoots. The next two years \u201cwere a very fast growing-up lesson,\u201d she said. By 2002, she was 16 and in New York to make the modeling rounds, without any of relatives on hand. Sokola, who\u2019s expected to continue testifying Thursday, hasn\u2019t been asked yet about Weinstein. Prosecutors have said she was introduced to him while on that 2002 modeling trip to New York. In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward. The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006. Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress. \u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday. She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein\u2019s heart health, and then he and the model left the table together. Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2013 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2013 but didn\u2019t say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors. She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein\u2019s wealth and influence. Prosecutors have said they began investigating Kaja Sokola\u2019s claims after her attorneys called on the eve of Weinstein\u2019s first trial. But prosecutors set the inquiry aside after he was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed. They revived the Sokola investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed Weinstein\u2019s conviction. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Kaja Sokola\u2019s allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility. One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later. The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e5j8v227ko",
      "content": "Motown legend Smokey Robinson has denied allegations of sexual assault that were made by several former employees. In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, four female housekeepers accused the singer-songwriter of sexual battery including rape, plus false imprisonment and a number of labour violations. In a statement to the BBC, Robinson's lawyer Christopher Frost called the allegations \"vile\" and \"false\". \"As this case progresses, the evidence (the crucial element that guides us) will show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon - $50 million, to be exact,\" he said. Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one hits like Mary Wells' My Guy and the Temptations' My Girl. He was both a talent scout for the record label and one of its most prominent recording artists in his own right, known for songs like Tracks of My Tears, Shop Around and Tears of a Clown. He has spots in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Halls of Fame, and claims to have credits on more than 4,000 songs. His second wife, Frances, was also named in Tuesday's lawsuit, which claimed she contributed to a hostile work environment and failed to stop Robinson's alleged sexual misconduct. The women are suing under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4, due to the sexual misconduct allegations, including rape, being levelled against the musician. In the 27-page lawsuit they detail several incidents dating back to 2006 and allege they were pressured into sex. All four women, who are of Hispanic descent, said they had not come forward until now because they feared losing their livelihood, familial reprisal or embarrassment. Some were concerned the allegations could affect their immigration status. They are seeking at least $50m in damages and a jury trial. No police reports or criminal charges have been filed against the musician. The women's lawyers held a press conference on Tuesday, accusing Robinson of being a \"serial and sick rapist\" who \"must be stopped\". This drew the ire of the Robinson's legal team, who called it a \"bizarre\" attempt \"to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create\". \"We will have more to say in the coming days as we make our legal response, and in time Mr Robinson will respond in his own words,\" Mr Frost said. \"We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold. \"We will be asking the Court to dismiss the lawsuit. We will also be asking the Court to address that in their statements to the press about Mr Robinson, the plaintiff's attorneys have reached beyond the bounds of liberties that even lawyers are typically allowed in this context.\"",

      "content": "Brad Arnold, the singer with US rock band 3 Doors Down, has revealed he has been diagnosed with stage four kidney cancer. The 46-year-old said in an Instagram video that he has \"clear cell renal carcinoma that had metastasised into my lung\", adding: \"And that's stage four, and that's not real good.\" The band made it big in the early 2000s with hits like Kryptonite, Here Without You and It's Not My Time, and have sold more than 13 million albums in the US. \"Now, I believe It's Not My Time is really my song,\" Arnold wrote to fans in an accompanying caption. \"This'll be a battle so we need our prayers warriors!\" 3 Doors Down emerged from Mississippi to break through with their hit Kryptonite, which reached number three in the US in 2000. Their debut album The Better Life was the 11th biggest-selling album of the year in their home country. They returned to the top five with the 2002 singles Here Without You and When I'm Gone, and scored US number one albums with Seventeen Days in 2005 and a self-titled LP in 2008. They also performed at President Trump's first inauguration in 2017. In his video, the singer and drummer said: \"You know what, we serve almighty God, and he can overcome anything. So I have no fear. I am really, sincerely not scared of it at all. \"But it is going to force us to cancel our tour this summer, and we're sorry for that. \"And I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get, and I think it's time for me to maybe go listen to It's Not My Time a little bit, right?\" Clear cell renal carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, and stage four is the most serious, meaning it has spread to another part of the body.",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm8mny9k1mo",
      "content": "The Last of Us star Bella Ramsey has voiced support for awards shows keeping separate categories for male and female performers. The British star, who identifies as non-binary and asks to be referred to with they/them pronouns, said it was important that \"recognition for women in the industry is preserved\". \"But then, where do non-binary or gender non-conforming people fit into that? I don't know,\" Ramsey added. Ramsey has been nominated for best actress at the Baftas and Emmys. Other ceremonies such the MTV and Brit Awards have switched to all-encompassing gender-neutral prizes as the entertainment industry grapples with how non-binary actors should be treated by awards shows. Organisers of the Oscars said last year they were \"exploring\" the idea of merging the best actor and actress categories. Ramsey told Louis Theroux's podcast: \"If people call me an actress, I have a guttural 'ugh, that's not quite right' instinct to it. \"But I just don't take it too seriously. It doesn't feel like an attack on my identity. It's just a funny thing that doesn't really fit.\" Ramsey said they \"didn't find it insulting\" to be nominated for best actress at the Emmys. Theroux suggested that having a single category would mean \"basically a lot of women wouldn't get nominated\" - as happened when the Brits scrapped their best male and female categories in favour of a best artist award, and no women were nominated in 2023. Ramsey responded: \"I think it's so important that that's preserved - that the recognition for women in this industry is preserved. \"I think the gendered categories conversation's a really interesting one and I don't have the answer. I wish that there was something that was an easy way around it. \"I think that it is really important that we have a female category and a male category - but then, where do non-binary and gender con-conforming people fit into that? I don't know. \"I've literally sat and tried to think my way to the answer, and haven't got there. \"You could do it for the character portrayed - like, best performance in a female character. But then, what about when there are non-binary characters on screen? Which is few and far between at the moment. But where does a non-binary person playing a non-binary character fit in? I don't know. It's really complicated.\" There has also been a move towards referring to all performers as actors rather than using the term actress, but Ramsey said many people prefer to be called an actress \"and are really comfortable in that\". \"I've always just called myself an actor, but I don't think that those words [like actress] have to be taken away.\" The 21-year-old said they didn't think about the use of pronouns until The Last of Us started in 2023, \"and it was a question that I had and suddenly I had to choose\". \"I was so stressed out about it because I didn't know, and I didn't really care.\" Ramsey said they rejected the term non-binary \"for so long\" because they didn't want to be seen as being \"trendy\". \"It was just something that had been very obvious since I was young. I'd always call myself a tomboy, but it wasn't that I was like a boyish girl. I was always a bit of an inbetween, leaning more to the boy's side to be honest. \"I feel like I grew up more as a little boy than I did a little girl. I always felt more masculine or... yeah, more on that side of the spectrum, I guess.\" The question of how to categorise awards has been a long-running debate in the entertainment industry. Currently, most awards shows invite actors to submit themselves for the category they feel comfortable in. In 2022, The Crown's Emma Corrin, who identifies as non-binary, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think the categories are inclusive enough at the moment. It's about everyone being able to feel acknowledged and represented.\" In 2023, Yellowjackets star Liv Hewson, also non-binary, didn't enter the Emmys, saying: \"There's not a place for me in the acting categories. It would be inaccurate for me to submit myself as an actress. It neither makes sense for me to be lumped in with the boys.\" Others worry that gender-neutral categories would lead to women being underrepresented. After having all-male nominees for best artist in 2023, the Brits expanded the prize's shortlist from five to 10 acts. Trans actors are not affected by the issue, with Elliot Page being eligible for best actor and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n for best actress.",

Larry Lamb, who played Mick Shipman on the BBC's hit show for 17 years, said filming the Christmas episode last year was an \"extraordinary experience.\". He added: \"At the time, we all thought it probably won't be the end, I'm sure we will be doing it again, but gradually what's happened over the months, what I've realised is that was the end.\" Lamb said he would always carry a part of Mick with him, and his upcoming tour for his new book, All Wrapped Up, has a Gavin and Stacey theme. The Christmas episode of the show racked up 19.11 million views, and Lamb said while it was sad it ended, it was a \"masterpiece, no doubt about it\". He added: \"That scene in the wedding - that's up for the moment of the year. \"It was the way to end this story, you can't keep going on with it. Ruth and James brought it to a grand finale.\" While he has moved on to a new chapter, he clearly will always have a soft spot for the show, as seen with his new book tour. \"We're starting in Billericay in the Reading Rooms and we're going to finish in Barry in Marcos' cafe at a date to be arranged,\" he told BBC Essex. In between, Lamb will visit several bookshops and read extracts of his new novel. \"It's an adventure, it is all about a film crew going to a Caribbean island to make a film, and from the minute they set off, things go wrong,\" he revealed. \"It's letting me show people the inside story of what film and television is all about because that is something I have been asked countless times.\" Follow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

      "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjljw9j8yvo",
      "content": "Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9 has asked the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for a discussion on Israel's inclusion in the Eurovision Song Contest. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was \"appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages\". Earlier, the director of the Eurovision Song Contest said no participating EBU member had publicly opposed Israeli broadcaster Kan's participation. The contest, which is hosted by the EBU, will begin on 13 May in Switzerland with the final on 17 May. Mr Bakhurst said RT\u00c9 wanted a discussion \"notwithstanding the fact that the criterion for participating\" is membership of EBU. He added that he was mindful of RT\u00c9's obligations to maintain objectivity in covering the war in Gaza. \"We are also very mindful of the severe political pressure on Israel's public service broadcaster, Kan, from the Israeli government,\" he said. On Tuesday, more than 70  former Eurovision contestants, including Ireland's 1994 winner Charlie McGettigan, signed a letter urging organisers to ban Israel and Kan from the event. Members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) at RT\u00c9 had also called on the broadcaster to oppose Israel's participation in a letter. Speaking on Wednesday to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Emma O'Kelly of the NUJ said she welcomed Mr Bakhurt's statement and that it was important to take a stand. \"We believe this is RT\u00c9 listening to its staff, but more importantly, listening to public sentiment here in Ireland, which is just outrage at Israel's actions in Gaza,\" she said. \"We collectively \u2014 the NUJ and RT\u00c9 \u2014 don't believe Israel should be afforded what is a massive cultural platform.\" \"The Eurovision is literally the international stage,\" she added. \"We don't believe that the EBU should be giving a country such as this a platform.\" Ms O'Kelly said this move is \"only about Israel's actions in Gaza\" and added that there is \"precedent for this\", citing Russia being unable to participate in the competition from 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. In a statement, Eurovision director Martin Green said: \"No participating EBU member broadcaster, who have all been widely consulted, has 'publicly opposed' Israeli broadcaster Kan's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest - despite the claims in another letter from RT\u00c9 journalists. \"The broadcasters mentioned in the letter, RTVE in Spain and RTVSLO in Slovenia, requested a discussion and R\u00daV in Iceland has informed us of their foreign minister's comments on Kan's participation.\" Mr Green said the organisers of the song contest \"understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East\". He said EBU was not \"immune to global events\" but members together should ensure the event remains a \"universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music\". Israel is to be represented in the contest by Yuval Raphael, a survivor of the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. She was at the Nova musical festival when Hamas attacked and killed 360 young partygoers and took 40 more hostage. At least 52,615 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,507 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. There were several campaigns to block Israel from taking part in the  Eurovision song contest last year, but the EBU ruled Israel was allowed to compete. Representing Israel last year, Eden Golan was booed whilst performing at a dress rehearsal for the competition, which took place in Malmo, Sweden and confined to her hotel room when she wasn't performing, due to threats of harm to the Israeli delegation. She placed fifth in the competition with her entry Hurricane. The grand final of the this year's Eurovision Song Contest will take place in St Jakobshalle, Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday 17 May. The semi-finals taking place on Tuesday 13 and Thursday 15 May. Thirty-seven countries will take part, with 10 winning through from each semi-final. Five countries - the UK, Spain, Germany, France and Italy are guaranteed places in the grand final, as is the host Switzerland.",

Although Chivayo muted the original audio and replaced it with Jah Prayzah\u2019s latest song Ibvapo, eagle-eyed fans were quick to spot the song info on the screen. \u201cIt clearly shows \u2018Kumusoro\u2019 \u2013 a collaboration between Nicky Genius and Winky D,\u201d said one user. \u201cWhy mute the sound unless you didn\u2019t want people to hear it?\u201d Chivayo, an avowed ZANU PF supporter and activist, has not responded to comments online asking whether the music was his personal choice.  Wicknell Chivayo jamming to Winky D? pic.twitter.com/BxbyK5C9CB \u2014 EzaseMzansi (@ezase_mzansi_1) May 6, 2025  The timing of the post is odd considering Chivayo\u2019s previous criticism of Winky D. Just three months ago, he ridiculed the musician on social media for allegedly seeking his attention. Writing on X (formerly Twitter) in February, Chivayo said: \u201cTRUE STORY\u2026 aedza kutsvaga attention yangu but I\u2019ve never offered him anything because he\u2019s a puppet we opposition. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 ngavaite GO FUND ME to him even a Rolls Royce Phantom vaone kuti kana inokwana AQUA inobuda here.\u201d This came after speculation that Winky D was bitter about not receiving a luxury vehicle like other musicians aligned with the ruling party. Chivayo went further, telling Winky D\u2019s fans to crowdfund a car for him if they truly supported him. This was after Winky D\u2019s fiery lyrics.\u00a0 In his EP Love Potion, released on his birthday, the singer appeared to take direct aim at Chivayo: \u201cVanoti nemuzita rababa, apa ndofuti vaba, vhura meso hona ka, handitengeke nemota car.\u201d(They preach the word of God but they are the ones stealing. Open your eyes. I can\u2019t be bought with a car.) The rivalry between the two hit a peak in January 2025, when Winky D performed in Mbare for the first time in seven years. During the show, he took multiple lyrical swipes at Chivayo and others aligned with Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling party. In a fiery performance, Winky D continued: \u201cNdabva paJabhuna horaiti chiitai, musandipe tuma notes handina teacher ini, ndapfuura 40 handidi teacher ini\u2026\u201d(I left HICC, it\u2019s fine, do your own thing. Don\u2019t give me notes\u2014I\u2019m not a student anymore.) Observers say this was likely aimed at fellow Zanu PF supporter Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who was linked to booting Winky D out of HICC. While Chivayo continues his spree of gifting cars to artists aligned with the ruling party, Winky D has taken a different route\u2014declaring his independence through lyrics. \u201cHanditengese. Handisi Peter. Ndendiri zii, handina noise, handisi speaker ini,\u201d Winky D added during his Mbare set.(I\u2019m not for sale. I\u2019m not Peter. I stay silent\u2014I\u2019m not the loudspeaker.) Whether Chivayo intended to play Winky D\u2019s music or not, the video has fans talking\u2014and speculating. \u201cThat was Kumusoro playing. We all saw it,\u201d one Facebook commenter noted. \u201cDeep down, he knows the music slaps.\u201d \u201cSo Wicknell bashes Winky D in public but vibes to his music in private? The hypocrisy is real!\u201d\u00a0 said another user. Others found humour in the situation. \u201cEven Wicknell can\u2019t resist Winky D\u2019s music\u2014who can blame him?\u201d joked another.

      "content": "Springboks captain Siya Kolisi\u2019s sister jokingly laughed at Rachel, saying she always wants to be in her space. Siya and his wife Rachel recently shocked fans with news of their divorce. After 11 years of marriage, the couple publicly announced their split but reassured everyone of mutual respect and continued co-parenting. Despite the emotional challenges of separation, their family ties appear stronger than ever. Surprisingly, one bond that hasn\u2019t wavered is the one between Rachel and Siya\u2019s younger sister, Liphelo Kolisi. Fans expected tension, but instead, they\u2019ve seen laughter, love, and playful banter.

      "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/f1/jack-doohan-alpine-f1-colapinto-briatore-b2746411.html",
      "content": "Doohan lasted seven races at Alpine, while Liam Lawson was two and out at Red Bull. With Franco Colapinto being handed a simple five-race deal, another change could be in the offing after Silverstone in July I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice How long has the writing been on the wall for Jack Doohan at Alpine? About four months. The moment Franco Colapinto was acquired from Williams as a reserve driver in January, it did not take a mastermind to ascertain that the Australian\u2019s tenure in a race seat was set to be short-lived. It was a ticking time bomb of a driver seat. The last 24 hours of chaotic announcements emanating from the Alpine press office also tell us what we\u2019ve known, Netflix and all, since his shock return last summer: Flavio Briatore is at the wheel of the ship. A ship on very rocky waters. Many will be sad to see former team principal Oliver Oakes depart; a mild-mannered character, his first foray into F1 from junior formula did not even last 12 months. The Brit resigned on Tuesday night, with Briatore assuming all his responsibilities. Twelve hours later, Colapinto\u2019s five-race deal was confirmed. An internal disagreement over the driver swap? You do the maths. Briatore\u2019s return to the paddock is a moral complex in itself. The 75-year-old Italian maverick was given a lifetime ban from the sport after the infamous 2008 Crashgate scandal, in which it was alleged that the then-Renault boss and chief engineer Pat Symonds instructed their driver, Nelson Piquet Jr, to crash in order to assist a win for Fernando Alonso, which came to fruition. Briatore and Symonds denied the charges, but Renault did not contest them in a 2009 FIA hearing. Yet Briatore himself contested his lifetime ban in a French court and had it overturned. Technically, he has been allowed to return to the sport since 2013. A brutal taskmaster, Briatore featured heavily in the most recent season of Drive to Survive, his most memorable appearance being when he told Doohan: \u201cI control you every millimetre.\u201d His corrupt past does undoubtedly casts a shadow over his return now. Liam Lawson \u2013 2 races, Red Bull 2025 Yuji Ide \u2013 4 races, Super Aguri, 2006 Nicolas Kiesa \u2013 5 races, Minardi 2003 Jack Doohan \u2013 7 races, Alpine 2024-25 Nyck de Vries \u2013 10 races, AlphaTauri 2023 Karun Chandhok \u2013 10 races, HRT 2010 *discounting temporary stand-ins Perhaps the only solace for Doohan, as he reacclimatises to his former life as a back-up once again, was that he started one more race than the early-season rumour of five grands prix and out. The 22-year-old also lasted four races longer (five if you include his appearance at last year\u2019s season-finale in Abu Dhabi) than Liam Lawson, after his demotion from Red Bull to sister team Racing Bulls following just two races. Yet with Lawson the unwanted record holder of the shortest stint in a full-time F1 seat, Doohan now takes his place in fourth on the list. It presents a somewhat complex story surrounding rookie drivers in F1 currently. On one hand, six rookies (if you include Lawson) received a drive this year, a record number. Kimi Antonelli has hit the ground running at Mercedes, Ollie Bearman has shown flashes of brilliance at Haas and Gabriel Bortoleto is being afforded time at Sauber, given their lack of competitiveness. Isack Hadjar has also been an unlikely star at Racing Bulls. Terrific for those who believe in the philosophy of giving youth a chance, in any sport, at any level. Yet, contrastingly, is a shot at the big time even worth it if you\u2019re only allowed a handful of races to prove your worth, as was the case with Lawson and Doohan? Knowing that one weekend could wreck your career trajectory, is the pressure too high? Clearly, a 20-car grid lends itself to a frenetic driver market. Colapinto\u2019s impressive nine-race stint at Williams at the end of last year \u2013 in the knowledge that a full-time seat was not feasible in 2025 \u2013 made the much-loved Argentine the big wildcard heading into this season. Williams were happy to let Colapinto head for pastures new. Briatore came calling, got his man, and now hands him his shot, starting at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix next week. But he does not have long to leave a lasting impression. Briatore makes it clear that the 21-year-old has until Silverstone in July \u2013 not even the summer break, two races later \u2013 to prove his worth. At that point, merely halfway through the 24-race season, the spot of Pierre Gasly\u2019s teammate will be reassessed once again. What\u2019s more, as harsh a call as it is on Doohan, he has not done enough. Two costly crashes \u2013 one on lap one of his home race in Australia and another in practice in Japan \u2013 were indicative of a driver under the cosh before he was even in the cockpit. Clearly, a first-lap collision with Lawson and subsequent retirement in Miami were the final straw. Yet sympathy will be radiating throughout the paddock. Doohan spent the opening weeks of his debut season, which should have been some of the most exciting of his life, rebuking queries about Colapinto\u2019s arrival. The season launch event in London saw a sharp response to one query, with an Alpine press officer refusing to allow any more questions on Colapinto. All in all, it felt uncomfortable. But now the torch passes to Colapinto. Briatore made clear that Alpine\u2019s horizons are set on new regulations next year \u2013 when they will take Mercedes engines for the first time \u2013 and they want to finalise a solid driver line-up for 2026. Pierre Gasly seems set to be their leader and the Frenchman has even mentioned targeting a world championship next year, as outlandish an ambition as that seems. But who will be his teammate? Colapinto has a mere five grands prix to show his mettle. Doohan and fellow reserve Paul Aron remain waiting in the wings, eager for a call-up from the unpredictable Briatore. A chance could be on the cards again ahead of Spa-Francorchamps in late July. Two years ago, the axing of Nyck de Vries after 10 races felt brutal. Now, some drivers would be desperate for that number. Rookies are being handed their chance but with an unprecedented catch: get up to speed quickly, or you\u2019re out. The sport has never been so ruthless to its newbies. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies",

      "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/giro-d-italia-tadej-pogacar-primoz-roglic-juan-ayuso-b2745860.html",
      "content": "The defending champion may be skipping the corsa rosa but his absence leaves the door open to compatriot Primoz Roglic I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our Privacy notice There will be no repeat of Tadej Pogacar\u2019s masterclass at the 2024 Giro d\u2019Italia. \u201cPink Pog\u201d will not be back to defend the title he barely worked up a sweat in securing last year, to the dismay/relief (delete as appropriate) of observers and the rest of the cycling world. But in the absence of cycling\u2019s present, this year\u2019s Giro line-up features its past and future. The out-and-out favourites are Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe\u2019s Primoz Roglic, a four-time Vuelta champion and Giro winner in 2023, who may count himself unlucky to be only the second-best Slovenian cyclist of all time. The 35-year-old will go toe to toe with Pogacar\u2019s disciple, young Spaniard Juan Ayuso, who is searching for his first grand tour title. A far cry from Pogacar\u2019s procession to Rome last year, the 2025 edition should be a serious fight. The pair did battle in a fascinating Volta a Catalunya in March, with momentum swinging between the two even over the course of individual stages. On the final day, Ayuso looked to have the upper hand but Roglic \u2013 never one to underestimate \u2013 ultimately won in dominant fashion with a final-stage 20km solo to victory. But the Giro is quite a different beast. And with two time trials, a plethora of hilly stages, and a trio of difficult mountain stages in the final week, the fight for the title could go right down to the penultimate day. Victory for Ayuso would underline his status as Pogacar\u2019s second-in-command at UAE Team Emirates-XRG, and perhaps fuel a desire, occasionally sensed bubbling under the surface, for a greater share of the limelight than he is awarded at the super-team. For Roglic, this would prove to all his younger competitors \u2013 the likes of ex-teammate Vingegaard, Pogacar, and Remco Evenepoel \u2013 that he\u2019s very much still a player in this game. Beyond the two front-runners, this Giro is shaping up to be one of its most open editions in some time. UAE Team Emirates-XRG have a second card to play in Adam Yates, a super-domestique and a man with grand tour pedigree himself, having finished third in the Tour de France in 2023. Bahrain-Victorious have home hopeful Antonio Tiberi, who impressed last year, finishing fifth. Visma-Lease a Bike have winter signing Simon Yates, who won the Vuelta in 2018 and moved for another shot at grand tour glory, as well as Wout van Aert, an all-terrain machine who was in fine form during the spring classics, although a win eluded him. Frenchman Romain Bardet may not be a serious contender for the title but will certainly hope for a good showing at his final grand tour before his retirement from road racing. Then there\u2019s Tom Pidcock. His Q36.5 squad have been granted a wildcard for the Giro \u2013 no doubt a direct result of his star power \u2013 and the Brit has had an excellent spring to kickstart life with the team. This is the 25-year-old\u2019s first grand tour post-Ineos and offers him a fresh start. He\u2019ll be the undisputed leader, and while his ProTour outfit doesn\u2019t have the same calibre as some of the other squads, the team has looked revitalised since he joined over the winter. The Olympic mountain bike champion, Pidcock has proved himself capable on almost all terrain and, as such, has a decision to make on how he attacks this race. Q36.5 may not be able to support a full-on tilt at the general classification and the maglia rosa, but a number of early hilly stages certainly suit him and a top 10 placing at least looks within his grasp. It seems feasible that the team may make their decision on what he should target, whether it be stage-hunting or a full GC campaign, as the race goes on. And what of Pidcock\u2019s former team? Ineos Grenadiers have selected an intriguing line-up, mostly consisting of common-or-garden domestiques, solid if not spectacular. It feels a squad largely built around the GC challenge of Thymen Arensman, a second-tier three-week racer who could be well positioned to strike if either of the favourites show signs of weakness. He looked to capitulate early in last year\u2019s corsa rosa, losing four minutes in the opening few days, before resurrecting himself and building an admirable challenge in the final week to finish sixth for the second year in a row. The Ineos squad also leaves possible room for Egan Bernal, a sparkling talent who likely could have rivalled Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard in recent years had he not been on the mend from a hideous, life-threatening crash in early 2022. The Colombian has shown flashes of his early brilliance this year, winning both the road race and time trial national titles and impressing at Clasica Jaen before being sidelined with a collarbone fracture. A return to the form that saw him win the 2021 Giro \u2013 Ineos\u2019s last grand tour title \u2013 feels unlikely, but his presence gives the team options. The other Ineos rider of note is 21-year-old British talent Josh Tarling, a time-trial specialist and all-round engine, and one to watch for breakaways and possible stage wins.

      "content": "The New York Knicks fought back from a 20-point third-quarter deficit for the second straight game against the Boston Celtics to open up a 2-0 series lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Jalen Brunson made two clutch free throws with 12.7 seconds remaining to give the Knicks a one-point lead, before Mikal Bridges made another game-winning steal, this time on Jayson Tatum, to secure a huge 91-90 win at TD Garden. Related article\nSteph Curry out for at least a week after injury in Game 1 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves Teams that win the first two games of a playoff series on the road advance to the next round 85.7% of the time, per the Associated Press. The defending champions are now in real danger of being eliminated with the next two games at a raucous Madison Square Garden. \u201cTwo games we\u2019re up 20 points (and) somehow end up not with wins is inexcusable,\u201d Boston star Jaylen Brown, who was the victim of Bridges\u2019 game-winning steal in the series opener, told reporters. \u201cObviously, being down two, it sucks. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to show what we\u2019re made of,\u201d Brown added. \u201cObviously, we wouldn\u2019t like to be in this position, but we\u2019re here now, so we got to respond.\u201d No team in the history of the NBA has shot more three-pointers than this version of the Celtics, but it has been their undoing so far in this series, going a combined 25-of-100 from deep across Games 1 and 2 \u2013 including missing a league playoff-record 45 triples in the opener. The Celtics offense crumbled in the fourth quarter, missing 14 of its final 15 shots that included an incredible run of more than eight minutes without a bucket. It has been a remarkable start to the series for a Knicks team that finished 10 games back from the No. 1 seed Celtics and got swept 4-0 in the teams\u2019 regular season matchups. Josh Hart finished with a game-high 23 points for the Knicks, while Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 17 rebounds. Brunson, the 2024-25 Clutch Player of the Year, had 17 points \u2013 including the Knicks\u2019 last six of the game \u2013 and seven assists. After shooting 0-for-8 through the first three quarters, Bridges scored all 14 of his points in the fourth before his crucial steal at the end. Bridges said after the game that the team is \u201cjust finding ways to win.\u201d For the Celtics, Derrick White and Brown had 20 points, but it was a tough night for Tatum who finished with 13 points on 5-of-19 shooting. Game 3 is at Madison Square Garden in New York on Saturday. The Oklahoma City Thunder demolished the Denver Nuggets 149-106 on Wednesday to level the series at 1-1. Oklahoma set a new NBA playoff record for points scored in a half, dropping a staggering 87 in the first half against the Nuggets. Denver, who fired longtime head coach Michael Malone just before the playoffs, snatched a win in Game 1 with a late Aaron Gordon three-pointer, but Game 2 was never even a contest as the Thunder raced out to a 24-point, first-quarter lead. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a game-high 34 points for the Thunder to go with eight assists and four rebounds, while Chet Holmgren posted a double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds. All five Thunder starters, plus three players off the bench, hit double figures in the rout. Nikola Joki\u0107, Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s rival for the MVP award, scored just 17 points and fouled out in the third quarter. The three-time MVP had a historic 42-point, 22-rebound performance in Game 1. Game 3 is in Denver on Saturday.",

      "content": "Rory McIlroy says he feels \u201ca lot less pressure\u201d as he prepares to return to major action having ended years of heartbreak with his victory at the Masters last month. The Northern Irishman was finally able to slip on the famous green jacket and enter himself into the record books \u2013 becoming the sixth golfer to complete the career grand slam of winning each of golf\u2019s four majors \u2013 after prevailing at Augusta National, sparking emotional scenes of celebrations. With that monkey off his back, McIlroy returns to major action at next week\u2019s PGA Championship at Quail Hollow. And by ending an 11-year wait for his fifth major title, the 35-year-old admitted that he\u2019s going to arrive in Charlotte, North Carolina, with far fewer expectations on his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m obviously going to feel more comfortable and a lot less pressure, and I\u2019m also going back to a venue that I love. It\u2019s nothing but positive vibes going in there next week with what happened a few weeks ago and then with my history there and how well I\u2019ve played at Quail,\u201d McIlroy told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the Truist Championship in Philadelphia. \u201cIt probably will feel a little bit different. I probably won\u2019t be quite as on edge as I have been for the last few years when I\u2019ve been at major championships. I\u2019ll probably be a little bit better to be around for my family, and I\u2019ll be a little more relaxed. I think overall it will be a good thing.\u201d Related article\nRory McIlroy could go onto win 10 majors now Masters \u2018shackles are off,\u2019 says men\u2019s captain of his hometown golf club There\u2019s a reason for McIlroy to be so confident heading into the second major of 2025. He won the Truist Championship by five shots last year at Quail Hollow when it was staged there and already has gotten off to an excellent start on the PGA Tour this season with two other victories outside of his Masters triumph. This year, the tournament is being held on the Wissahickon Course at the Philadelphia Cricket Club as McIlroy seeks to defend his crown and claim his fifth Truist Championship title in the process. McIlroy said that he\u2019s cherished his time celebrating his Masters victory with friends and family, describing him and his mom being a \u201cmess for a few minutes\u201d when they first saw each other afterwards. \u201cLook, as an only child, I have a bond,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky, and I know a lot of people feel this, that they have a close bond with their parents, but I think as time goes on and I\u2019m getting a little older, I realize that they\u2019re not going to be around forever. It means even more that they were still around to be able to see me complete the slam and fulfill those dreams.\u201d But he admitted he\u2019s also enjoyed returning to the day job having stepped back into competitive action at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last week. \u201cGood to be here. First week, I guess, as an individual coming back and playing over the last few weeks. I\u2019m excited to get back to being a golfer,\u201d the world No. 2 said.",

      "content": "Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry is out for at least a week and set to miss multiple games of his team\u2019s second-round series against the Minnesota Timberwolves after suffering an injury on Tuesday night. The Warriors won Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinals series against the Minnesota Timberwolves 99-88, despite losing Curry to a hamstring injury midway through the second quarter. The team said in a statement that he has a strained left hamstring and he will be reevaluated in a week, meaning he could possibly return for Game 5, which is scheduled for May 14 if necessary. Curry\u2019s injury came on a history-making night in the NBA playoffs. With the Warriors\u2019 win over Minnesota, the road team has now won the first game in each of the four conference semifinals series, the first time that\u2019s happened in league history. The Indiana Pacers took that a step further, grabbing a shock 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals against the No. 1 seed Cleveland Cavaliers thanks to a dagger shot from Tyrese Haliburton to snatch a 120-119 road victory. Here\u2019s how another intriguing evening of NBA postseason action played out. Having stunned the Eastern Conference\u2019s No. 1 seed Cavaliers in Game 1, the Pacers were riding high for the second game of their series. The Cavs were seeking to rebound from a disappointing opening game, but were dealt a big blow when three key players \u2013 Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and De\u2019Andre Hunter \u2013 were all ruled out through injury. But despite those absences, it was the home team that was in the ascendancy for most of the game, building a 20-point lead at one point as it looked to be heading to level the series. Cleveland\u2019s lead was 11 at halftime, with guard Donovan Mitchell \u2013 who finished with 48 points, five rebounds, nine assists and four steals \u2013 excelling throughout. But as the game went on, Indiana slowly but surely chipped away at the lead until it was a three-point game with 27 seconds remaining. A key turnover forced by Andrew Nembhard gave the Pacers possession with time ticking away, after which Haliburton was fouled to send him to the free-throw line with 12.4 seconds remaining, trailing by three. What happened next was basketball drama in its purest form. TY!!!!!!!! WHAT A WIN !!!!!! @Pacers Haliburton made his first free throw then missed his second from the line but managed to soar and claim the rebound. The 25-year-old was able to relocate to the top of the arc where he maneuvered the ball until he was able to launch a three-point attempt over Ty Jerome. The ball soared through the hoop with just 1.1 seconds remaining and after a heave from Jerome fell short, the Pacers celebrated their second straight surprise road victory over Cleveland. Haliburton\u2019s shot was his second game-winner of the playoffs already, having done so in Game 5 against the Milwaukee Bucks in the previous round. Per ESPN, Haliburton became only the second player since 1997-98 with multiple go-ahead field goals in the final two seconds in a single postseason alongside LeBron James in 2018. The moment sparked wild celebrations on the court but also on social media from many of Haliburton\u2019s peers, including fellow Indianapolis-based star guard Caitlin Clark who said on X: \u201cTY!!!!!!!! WHAT A WIN !!!!!!\u201d Haliburton was more understated, praising the rest of his teammates. \u201cWe just have a resilient group, man,\u201d Haliburton, who finished with 19 points, nine rebounds and four assists, said. \u201cWe just figure out ways to win. We don\u2019t give up. We\u2019re battle-tested as a group. We\u2019ve basically been together for about two years now and that continuity has been really good for us.\u201d According to ESPN, there have been only three occasions a team has won after trailing by at least seven points in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime in a playoff game out of 1,643 games since the 1997-98 season, and the Pacers account for two of those three this postseason alone. As the series travels to Indiana for Game 3 and 4, the Pacers hold a two-game lead with the Cavaliers \u2013 who had the second-best regular season record in the league \u2013 needing a big comeback to salvage anything from this year. The Warriors know a thing or two about winning NBA titles and they showed the resilience needed to make a deep postseason run with their performance in Game 1 against the Timberwolves. Coming off a seven-game slugfest against the Houston Rockets, Golden State raced into an early lead against a sluggish-looking Minnesota team which struggled to get to grips with the Warriors\u2019 dynamic ball-movement and shooting. But Golden State looked to have been dealt a serious blow when two-time NBA MVP Curry was seen clutching his left hamstring in the second quarter before walking gingerly to the locker room. The 37-year-old would not return to the game after scoring 13 points in 13 minutes. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said that Curry had a hamstring strain and the team announced the full extent of the injury on Wednesday afternoon. Golden State led 25-20 when Curry left and, in his absence, the rest of the roster stepped up in a tricky environment. The Warriors led 76-53 midway through the third quarter and although the Wolves clawed their way back, the lead was too big to come back from. With Curry out of the lineup, it was left to other players to shine. Draymond Green had 18 points \u2013 including four triples \u2013 to go with eight rebounds, six assists and two steals, while Jimmy Butler nearly had a triple-double with 20 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. Meanwhile, Buddy Hield continued his hot scoring run with 24 points. While the Warriors showed resiliency, the T-Wolves lacked the urgency which saw them beat the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. It was a lackluster performance from their own star guard, Anthony Edwards, who missed his first 10 shots and didn\u2019t get a bucket until four minutes into the second half. He notched 22 of his 23 points in the game\u2019s final 20 minutes, by which time the Warriors already had a large lead. Afterwards, Minnesota head coach Chris Finch called out his star\u2019s performance. \u201cIt starts with \u2018Ant.\u2019 He struggled early, and then you could just kind of see the light go out for a while,\u201d Finch told reporters. \u201cI think it was one of those games where he came out with a predetermined mindset of what he was going to do.\u201d Finch added: \u201cWhat is there to talk about? You\u2019re the leader of the team, and you got to come out and set the tone in all ways that that happens, and if your shot\u2019s not going, you still have to carry the energy.\u201d",
